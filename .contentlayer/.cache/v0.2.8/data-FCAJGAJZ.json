This is the very first email I'm sending out on my newsletter and I can't wait to hear from you.\n\n---\n\n## Over optimization yields zero results\n\n> A wood cutter who only sharps his axe doesn't make a dime.\n>\n> – Aravind\n\nWe are generally obsessed with optimizing every part of our lives. In my case, I want the perfect setup to write blogs. I’ve been working on this for weeks trying different setups and apps for writings. I dreamed of a writing setup where I would write on the iPad and it automatically gets built and deployed to my website. I went through [setups](https://francescodilorenzo.com/blog-setup) of people who did this. **But you can only get inspired by other setups as they generally don’t fit perfectly in your routine.**\n\nInstead of doing that, I could have written more than 5 articles if I shifted my focus and energy to producing instead of optimizing. I finally ditched it and move back to [writing markdown in my website’s repository](/writings/perfect-writing-setup/) which then gets built and deployed. This might not be the most efficient, but this allows me produce content faster without thinking/figuring out much.\n\nSimilar thing happened with this newsletter. I wanted to start one back in January. But then, I spent a lot of time researching on various options, trying to build tools that allow me to get the dream setup. At least here I’m happy that I have a working setup to send newsletters to subscribers. Reply to this mail if you'd like to learn more about the setup.\n\nSo the moral of the story is try producing content first and then optimize instead of doing it the other way. It doesn’t make sense to think about an edge case which has very less probability of occuring.\n\n---\n\nThis is an article I'm working on and soon will publish on [my blog](/writings/). But I'm curious to hear back from you. What do think? Have you tried to optimize before doing something?\n\nHave a good week ahead 🔥\n\nAravind\n",

          "raw": "\nHello,\n\nHow's it going? Let's talk about [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) on iOS.\n\niOS shortcuts are a game changer. It was one of the reasons I bought an iPhone. _(Well, at least I feel good when I think like that)_\n\nIf there is a task that takes opening up a few apps and clicking buttons in it, it can be done with a single click using Shortcuts. It’s crazy.\n\n## Save Tweets for later\n\nLet’s look at a shortcut which **adds a Tweet to my To Do app**. _Why? You have bookmarks in Twitter, right? — you may ask._ I don’t want to use bookmarks for tweets that I just want to have a look later, and not save them. So, it’s helpful if I just add to my To Do app which I can check off after having a look at it. And to do this, we would have to copy the tweet’s URL, open the To Do app, and paste it. But with shortcuts, I can just share the tweet to the shortcut from the share menu, and it gets added.\n\n## What did I tweet?\n\nMany a times, I want to look at my tweets about a topic. I can use Twitter search for it — `from:aravindballa search-string`. But when I want to lookup when I’m drafting a tweet, I have to save tweet as a draft and search it in the app. Instead, I have a Shortcut which prompts me to enter a string, and then opens Safari page with the search results. This lets me easily look at past tweets and copy the URL if I want to link it.\n\n## What’s playing?\n\nI collect songs interesting songs on the go from places like cafes and restaurants. Some play cool music. I look up on Shazam for the song and save it to a playlist in Apple Music. That takes a few clicks. But with Shortcuts, one tap and the song gets added to a playlist.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/aravindballa/status/1354698318018793476\n\n## Custom icons on iPhone Home screen\n\nThere was a wave of people doing funky things with their home screens when someone found out you can have custom icons for apps using shortcuts. Mainly because you couldn’t do those kind of customizations on iOS earlier . Few made a lot of money selling icon packs. Mine is minimal.\n\n<div class=\"w-64\">\n\n![img](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EufXErHVEAgPhSb?format=jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nMore shortcuts will be added for the blog post that I'm still writing. This is an excerpt from it. I'll let you know once that post is out. I have a [tweet thread on few Shortcuts I use](https://twitter.com/aravindballa/status/1374378152550494223).\n\nI've also changed my complete knowledge consumption workflow with the help of Shortcuts. Now they help me take notes better on blog posts, tweet threads and stuff. I will tweet once I make few demo videos of it.\n\nIf you are on iOS and would like to try out any of the shortcuts, reply or DM on Twitter and I'd be happy to share.\n\nBrittik and I recorded an episode on Shortcuts for the [Learning Curve Pod](https://learningcurve.dev/). Here is the ep if you want to give a listen - https://learningcurve.dev/21-i-os-shortcuts-we-use\n\n---\n\n## Learning Curve update\n\nWe've recorded 3 episodes in the last week. Looks like we are on a role here! I think we are on a good setup to record episodes. We use this tool called [Zencastr](https://zencastr.com) which helps us to get on a call, and record ourselves. The recording happens locally on our machines and it gets backup to their cloud. After we finish, we download both the videos, his and mine, then off to the post processing.\n\nWe like this. And will release those episodes weekly. To tease what's coming next, Brittik and I are doing intermittent fasts (16:8). We want to record an episode on out experience doing this and what we've learnt.\n\nReleased today - https://open.spotify.com/episode/1qjrm0tE4PTekohla09ZRd?si=eQRPevoeToCno47CnS09hA\n\n---\n\n## Interesting reads\n\n- https://www.nirandfar.com/todo-vs-schedule-builder/\n- https://twitter.com/chris_herd/status/1375429865281875976\n\n---\n\nPhew, this was a long write up.

          "raw": "\nYou might have know from my previous letters that I'm rebuilding my website using NextJS.\n\nTurns out, recording videos while working on it harder. And it doesn't make sense to record the non interesting parts, or parts where a lot of manual work is involved instead of creative work. There is one video yet to be edited where I set up themes (dark & light) using Tailwind CSS. I worked on the parts where I had to fill up the content from my old website. And I'll record more videos when I start working on interesting things like `/bookshelf` page, page views counter, etc.\n\nA few notes from the commits I pushed recently\n\n**Images were hard**. Especially because I was coming from Gatsby where the images are local entities. With `next/image` and `next-mdx-loader`, they either should be in the public directory, or should come from an external url. But I have them locally in directories. file-loader came to the rescue.\n\nI'm also thinking of moving the images out of the repository to a cloud like S3 or Cloudinary.\n\nHere is how I used **Web fonts** for the best font loading performance.\n\n- Add the font files locally (in public folder).

If you haven’t read it yet, I highly recommend getting a copy. It’s short\none packed with gold. I couldn’t resist taking notes while reading the book. These are my takeaways from it.\n\n### Share your journey\n\nWe generally have the tendency to share things when we release something. We announce when we are done. But then, that announcement, on social media, doesn’t get the reach and engagement we wanted to have.\n\nIn comparison, imagine you were tweeting about what you are building at every small win. These series of tweets are capable of reaching more eyes. And people who resonate will stick around.\nPeople connect with the stories. Not just success stories, but also failure ones. Tell how you failed. And what you learned from it. Stories make us human.\n\n> But human beings are interested in other human beings and what other human beings do.\n\n### Be discoverable\n\n> But it’s not enough to be good. In order to be found, you have to be findable.\n\nThis is the key #1 takeaway for me. How will anyone find out about you if are not discoverable. Put yourself out there.\n\nHow? 👇\n\n### Teach what you know\n\n> Teaching people doesn’t subtract value from what you do, it actually adds to it. When you teach someone how to do your work, you are, in effect, generating more interest in your work.\n\nPeople feel closer to your work when you let them know how it's done. You grow more as a community, than as an individual who is working by keeping their methods as a secret.\n\nWhen one teaches, two learn. The person you are teaching and you.\n\nWhen you try explaining to others, that topic gets clarified in your head as well. In turn, you will be developing a strong understanding of that topic.\n\nDon’t assume what you know is obvious and think that others would know it as well.\n\n---\n\nThat’s all for this letter.

          "raw": "\n_Hi, I’m Aravind Balla and you are reading letter 12 from the Hackletter where I talk about my learnings and give you behind the scenes of things I keep doing for fun._\n\nI recently built a corner on my website with the details of the books I read on Kindle and the highlights I take while reading them. I call it – [Bookshelf](https://aravindballa.com/bookshelf/). _What else would I?_. Thanks to modern technology, the website updated automatically while I keep reading and I don't have to push a button.\n\nI want to talk about how I did that in this letter.\n\n## Secret sauce 🍅\n\nReadwise plays a huge role here. Readwise is a service that syncs your highlights and notes from a lot of sources. Kindle happens to be a popular and the most used source (for me). In this case, Readwise is responsible for getting all the highlights and the book details into my digital bookshelf.\n\nI make API calls to Readwise with my API token and fetch all the details I need to show on my bookshelf.\n\nReadwise referral if you'd like to try it - [https://readwise.io/i/aravind1](https://readwise.io/i/aravind1)\n\n## How does it automatically update, though?\n\nMy website is basically a bunch of static pages. And I use NextJS, a framework based on ReactJS to generate those static pages. It's powerful. Let me tell you how.\n\nIt has a cool feature called Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), which allows a particular page on the website to **rebuilt on the fly** to be always upto-date. When someone visits the page, it tries to rebuild the page on its servers to check for new content.\n\nThe interesting advantage I get here is – if this new build fails for some reason, like API spec changes or API doesn't work anymore, I still have the old page live. Nothing is lost and there is no downtime.\n\nAll the pages in the bookshelf are ISR enabled, so they stay updated, always.\n\n## Hiccups ⏹\n\nIt wasn't a complete cake walk, at least while deploying. Readwise's API has a rate limit. We can only fetch the data, highlights or the book details, certain times in a minute. As my website was statically generated, it tried to fetch highlights for all the books while building the site and deploying. It would always fail.\n\nHow did I solve it? _By not building the book pages (the one's with highlights)._\n\nThis is another area where NextJS shines. I can ask it to build the pages when the user visits and not build it at the time of deployment. If the page is not yet built, it builds it. If it is already built, it serves it from the cache. As it is deployed on an [Edge network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching), there are copies of the cache across the world and pages are served very fast to the users. This is some sort of delayed static site generation.\n\nThe code is completely **opensource** - [https://github.com/aravindballa/website/tree/master/pages/bookshelf](https://github.com/aravindballa/website/tree/master/pages/bookshelf)\n\n## What's in for the future\n\nI would like to add my takes on the highlights and write full length summaries from the notes I take while reading the books.\n\n_And what about physical books?_ I don't know yet. I'm sure I can add the books manually to\n\nReadwise and add highlights using the OCR feature of their mobile app. I will have opinions when I try this.\n\nAudio books? No idea, as well.\n\n---\n\nThanks reading and I’d appreciate if you reply and let me know what you think about this. I'd love some feedback and suggestions. Share this with your friends if you think they’ll enjoy too.

Working on the right things is. Even if you don't work long hours, when you choose to work on things that are essential, you move close to your goals.\n\nI now plan my weeks. I think about what has to be done in the week so that I get a little close to my goals. If I don't plan things, I keep working on random things that come to me. It's like **moving but not in the right direction**. Planning helps me get that **direction right**.\n\nSaying No is an important skill. It creates time. When you plan stuff, you will not be able to say yes everything that comes your way. Because you know it can't be fitted in your schedule.\n\n## 2 essential parts - Zoom out and Zoom in\n\nZooming in the work you put in and zooming out is finding out what you want to work on. Both are important.\n\nI suggest you create a new note or take a piece of paper, and write down what you want to achieve this week.

And if you are looking to start your own, this isn’t probably the advice you should look at.\n\nThis is a custom tailored process that I like doing. I like adding a custom flair to the things I make or publish.\n\n### Writing ✍️\n\nAll the writing happens in Roam Research (or Obsidian as I'm juggling between the two). I add ideas to my daily notes whenever they pop up in my head. With a tag hl-inbox so I can filter them later on a page dedicated to newsletter when I sit to write. The key here is **writing down that idea as soon as it pops up**.\n\nI set aside time to write scheduled in my calendar, generally 9am to 10am everyday. As of writing this, the time is, 09:18.\n\n### Building the email 👨‍🔧\n\nThen I copy the content over to a markdown file and generate custom HTML email using a framework called [maizzlejs](https://maizzle.com/).\n\nNothing fancy, but this adds the fonts and colours I like. Makes it a little responsive. I get to use TailwindCSS for the styles, so its cool.\n\n### Sending the email 📮\n\nI use a service called [Mailbluster](https://mailbluster.com/) to send out this HTML email to subscribers. What’s cool about this is it uses SES to the send the mails, which means it very cost effective.\n\nMailbluster lets me manage my subscribers create lists and send campaigns.\n\nIt also has an API which I use to collect emails from my website/landing page. One extra cool thing - I send myself a Telegram notification whenever someone signs up. It’s lights up a smile on my face when I see it.\n\n> Is all of that required? Heck no.\n> Is it fun? Hell yeah! ⚡️\n\nDo you have an over engineered process like this too? I'd love to know. If you want me to expand on any of the sections above, reply to this mail and let me know.

I had to cancel my trek in the last minute because of few emergencies.\n\nNow on to this week's letter...\n\n## Calendar > Todolists\n\nI say this because calendars let you decide when you want to do that particular task, right when you enter it into your system.\n\n**Todo lists are great for a brain dump**, meaning – getting all the tasks out of your head into a list that can be managed later. And that later never comes. You will feel less overwhelmed after getting the tasks out. _Or more? Because now you have a huge list._\n\nThis doesn't make sure the task gets done. I know the apps these days allow you to schedule and add due dates to the tasks. But then it misses the context of how your day is, what meetings you have and at what times you are free.\n\nCalendars solve this exact problem. **You can schedule when you want to actually strike that task off, and follow it when the time comes.** All your meetings are in it already. Schedule time blocks and tell yourself you'll not get distracted during that time block. Do it.\n\n_But, what about tasks that are not scheduled and I want to do them some day when I feel like?_\n\nTodo lists. Yeah. Calendars are for things you want to get done.\n\nMy todo lists have only grown in size over the years. A lot of the tasks aren't relavant any more. This happened because I never went back to them and reviewed or scheduled or archived. **Review is a crucial part of any system that you want to stick to for longer.**\n\nThe best way, one that works for me, is to use both todo list and a calendar. Every week, I sort out the tasks I want to complete. I schedule few rough time blocks in the calendar for my week. And every morning after I write my morning pages, I schedule my day with things I want to get done.\n\n## Extra Resources\n\nThis is a video from Francesco, host of Keep Productive, explaining how he uses Todoist along side Google Calendar.\n\n[![YT Video](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iZomby5RNgA/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNAFEJQDSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCiauo9C9eZT24jDo7X1hsoAvPPrA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZomby5RNgA)\n\n---\n\nWhat do you think of this rant?

You have earphones plugged in and you are listening to great ideas from all over the world. _That's how you define podcasts, right?_ You are into it for 9 minutes and one idea in particular gives you that \"aha\" moment. You somehow connect it your previous idea, and you are experiencing this jolt of joy.\n\nYou stop, pull out your phone, pause this podcast, and you want to note it down. \"Opening Roam would take me minutes\", you tell yourself. So you open something quick like Drafts app, note a few point down and the timestamps of that podcast and resume that run.\n\nAfter you come home, you process these quick notes, get it into your PKM system and do nothing about it. _Wait, do nothing about it?_\n\nThis is exactly my story.\n\nI did nothing about it. But I'm changing that up. I'm curating the best content I listen on a [Mixtape](https://mixtape.balla.dev/).\n\n![](https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/24279/full_1632593327-artwork.jpg)\n\nThe format is super short. I clip the interesting parts, add a voiceover at the beginning, or in between, which might include my take on it, and publish.\n\nI've published 6 episodes till now and it's been fun.

I use a notebook and pen for day job which lies just beside my mouse on the table. It's always open - I make todos and do my thinking there.\n\nWhen it comes to [working on side projects](https://hackletter.email/22), I use Notion as you can properly organize things there.\n\nI don't need it for work as the tasks are already on a Jira board (or something similar) but for the side projects it's my job to organize.\n\n## Collect\n\nIdeas pop up at weird times. Luckily I have my phone around and I quickly open Notion and add it to relevant board. I can organize it later when I'm at the computer.\n\n## Keeping yourself posted\n\nI have my tasks as pages in a kanban board in Notion. When I'm working, I update the page. Not every task is small. Not every task can be complete in one go. So I keep updating the page.\nT\nhis single thing has kept me productive I can say.\n\n## Brain time\n\nIt also help me think better. [Starting with code](https://hackletter.email/21) is not always best. I can write down ideas in the card or brainstorm in it. There are some tasks that need you to come up with words and sentences. Writing copy for your website, for example.\n\nWhen you get some free time, you might not have the time to completely code that or even no access to a computer.

How are you doing?\n\nAravind: Thanks for having me again today. I am doing great. How are you doing?\n\nReddy: I am so happy and excited to know that you're launching your product and but before we jump in on that, let us keep the supplies a little while longer and you can introduce yourself in the meanwhile to our listeners.\n\nAravind: My name is aravind, and I am a software developer.\n\nAravind: I like solving problems jumping in and finding hacks and solutions for things that are not really there yet, but can be done.\n\nAravind: So, that's my forte.\n\nAravind: I have been on this racket before. So if you're curious you can go [check that episode](https://racket.com/reddy2go/re22y) out.\n\nAravind: So yeah, what I am building right now is called [Stackblocks](https://stackblocks.app), which it's a, it's a tool that allows people who write Substack newsletters embed the archive, in their websites.\n\nAravind: I have seen a lot of people, just have a subscribe box wherein they ask for an email and then just there is a button but there is no way to know what that person has sent before or has written before.\n\nAravind: So this tool will allow the visitor to see the archive like last posts or last five posts or even the top performing substack posts on the website.\n\nAravind: Even before they give you the email ID email address, so that's what I am trying to solve.\n\nReddy: That's really cool.\n\nReddy: So, in a way, because I personally hate putting myself stack, embed form anywhere because it just doesn't fit into the design and I will probably change the design of my website five times in the last five months.\n\nReddy: But not one says, it's kind of like harmoniously fitted in to the overall design aesthetic of the website.\n\nReddy: So I usually, I am just like, you know, just at the most Dropping a link and I say ho follow this link and go there and subscribe. Like I hate embedding that form because it just doesn't look good.\n\nReddy: This is really cool.\n\nReddy: Because if you have done this, this can love me to not just present that singular form, which says, hey, this is op stack, and we can connect.\n\nReddy: But also, like you said, it drops draws people in with some sort of Snippets, not only of the latest issue but even the best issues.\n\nReddy: So how do you see this? You know, like do you see this as something that Can be enabled on anyone's website regardless of the platform?\n\nAravind: Yes. Right now it supports normal HTML code. I mean if someone has used Jekyll or writes in markdown and built website using Gatsby NextJS all this modern tools, then HTML should suffice and then I have a tab for Webflow how to do it on Webflow, how to embed it in Notion because I've seen a lot of tools\nthese days are built on top of Notion, and we have a lot of site generators which use Notion as the CMS.\n\nAravind: So it supports Notion, which means it supports a whole lot of stuff out there.\n\nReddy: This is so good.\n\nReddy: Like you're tempting me to actually go back to using sub stack as a medium because I am always looking for the next new thing.\n\nReddy: You know, old and boring sub stack, at least to me.\n\nAravind: So as you talked about the styling thing, so what I am trying to do now, like right now is to allow people to customize the background color and the font color of the embedded.\n\nAravind: So that it looks like it's in your site and not just a piece of paper that is stuck out in your site.\n\nAravind: I want it to blend in into the users web sites. That's what I am working on right now.\n\nAravind: The next would be to add support for custom fonts if that's possible so that it has the same aesthetic.\n\nReddy: Wow, looks like you're offering more customization than sub stack itself. Yeah, but this is cool because I think, you know, one of the things that's missing because I have always been looking around on this.\n\nReddy: You know what, I call like a Holy Grail? This quest for you know, finding us a unified space where I can have some sort of website or web presence and also a Blog specially to garden and a new salon.\n\nReddy: The closest had come to Was Ghost which offers me to write in the same space and essentially send out the same things that I write on the website to someone's inbox.\n\nReddy: And I think this is taking a step further in that direction because people coming to my website, if they see the page where all my substitute posts are, they can get a feel of my writing, which is on sub stack, without leaving my home page. And I think that's very valuable to keep people because it's easy to lose an audience.\n\nReddy: You know, you have one Platform. And then there's another platform you use for sending things out. So it's difficult for people to know exactly where you decide.\n\nAravind: Yeah, and guess what, not just substack I am planning to like extend the features for other services, like Revuew or Tinymail or all these modern, things buttondown email and I figured out how to do that for a few providers. So after I build things for sub stack end-to-end, then it should be easy to add in.\n\nReddy: Look for other providers as well was also incredible news and think a lot of people were very happy about this cuz I think especially does the idea of having two separate spaces is so difficult to reconcile with on the internet today because otherwise everything kind of like fits in, right?\n\nReddy: We have this whole concept of apis and everything is connected with Zapier over the integral method Etc. And yet we have to like run around to different URLs just to access the content from a single person that seems so counterproductive to me.\n\nAravind: And that's what I am trying to not solve completely but at least move in a step towards that goal to have everything on your website, which is your digital home.\n\nReddy: Nice.\n\nReddy: So what's what do you see in the future for this particular product? And you already have some sort of another project in the making which you have already started ideating brainstorming about now.\n\nAravind: This project actually I started ideating it in January or February, but it took me this long to know that it's a valid problem and start work on it. I wish I should have talked to people earlier and then figured out that this is a valid problem. And I wish, I wish I started early.\n\nAravind: And right now I don't have anything else in mind, but as I do things and as I progress in my life, I am sure I will find some other problem, which I can provide a small solution to.\n\nReddy: Yeah, and do you, do you work on all of these entirely alone? Or is there some sort of team or you like working with someone on this project?\n\nAravind: It's completely me. It's just me completely.\n\nAravind: It's me who is designing the pages. It's me who is writing the code me who is setting up the emails. It's all just one person team for now, but I would love to get someone to Do things that I know how to do. I mean that just makes the process a little easier for me. But right now I am a single person team.\n\nReddy: Yeah that's cooler. Is this what people call the full stack developer where you do everything yourself?\n\nAravind: Yes, full stackdeveloper is basically a person who knows front-end and back-end and but this involves design and ideating and marketing as well. So, I don't know what this is called.\n\nReddy: Okay. Well, I wish you all the best.\n\nReddy: Thank you for hopping on and wish you all the best in the next project for the coming up with, and we would love to share this link. So just tell us how, you know, there's no scan find that URL fine, how to sign up for this etcetera.\n\nAravind: The website is called stack blocks and the URL is stack blocks and Dot app. That's where you can go to sign up and hop into the Early Access list.\n\nReddy: Sweet. So you heard it here and all the best elements you. Thank you.\n",

This is not intended if you have an API endpoint (backend) serving multiple types of clients(like mobile and web).\n\n> **Don't use this in production.** It's just an experiment.\n\nIt is a small experiment to check whether you can directly get the `html` for the component instead of fetching the JSON data and populating it in the React Component. Express is used for server rendered React output.\n\nGenerally in SSR, we have the routing logic in the React application, using `react-router` or some similar kind of library. The server (Express in our case) returns the complete React application for all routes and does not worry about routing.\n\n```javascript\napp.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\n  // ...\n  // res.send(renderToString(<App />)\n});\n```\n\nLet's build a special route, say `/getRenderedComponent`, to give the rendered HTML as a response, as a middleware.\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nexports.renderedCompMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {\n  const items = ['Milk', 'Coffee'];\n  const html = `\n<h2>Server rendered component</h2>\n<ul>\n  ${items.map((item) => `<li>${item}</li>`)}\n</ul>\n`;\n\n  if (req.path.match(/\\/getcomp/)) {\n    res.send({ html });\n    return;\n  }\n  next();\n};\n\n// server.js\napp.get('*', renderedCompMiddleware, (req, res, next) => {\n  // ...\n  // res.send(renderToString(<App />)\n});\n```\n\nWe included it as a middleware, so the request will pass through it. (This might not be the correct way of doing this. We should have a separate route for this).\n\nAt the middleware, we render the HTML. We can even use `react-dom/renderToString` and render a React component to send as a response.\n\nThis response can be consumed in a React component easily. Something which can fetch and render HTML inside it will do the job. Like our `SSRComp`.\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { fetchComp } from './api';\n\nfunction createMarkup(text) {\n  return { __html: text };\n}\n\nclass SSRComp extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      html: '<p>loading<p>',\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetchComp().then((html) => this.setState({ html }));\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const { html } = this.state;\n\n    return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup(html)} />;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default SSRComp;\n```\n\n```javascript\nexport function fetchComp() {\n  return fetch('/getcomp')\n    .then((data) => data.json())\n    .then((comp) => comp.html)\n    .catch((error) => {\n      console.warn(error);\n      return null;\n    });\n}\n```\n\nI don't have an exact idea of where this can be put to a real production environment but was a successful fun experiment.\n\nThanks for reading through.

Luckily, Brittik knew a thing about editing, so at least that was in place.\n\nAfter we recorded the first episode, we had 4 days to figure out things like publishing and creating a landing page, and this deadline helped us put in the work and launch. **We wouldn't have launched if we had to get everything ready before we recorded.** Yes, the first episode wasn't perfect, the audio wasn't clear but guess what, we launched. The website had a single page with a form to collect mail id of interested people.\n\n[Anchor](http://anchor.fm) app made it easy for us to upload audio and publish it across platforms, which was great. It handles all the distribution now and gives us good analytics on how the audience is. We didn't know about Anchor earlier.\n\nI used Gatsby to build our website, which was a single page, and it is hosted on [Netlify](http://netlify.com). It has a form, handled by Netlify Forms to collect mail id's of people interested and we promised to send a mail the podcast launches. We used [Buttondown](http://buttondown.email) for it where we manually imported subscribers from the Netlify form responses to Buttondown.\n\n# After launch\n\nWe published, sent out mails and tweeted about it. People listened to it and a few gave us feedback. Personally, I learnt a lot in this process. We improved episode by episode.\n\nI now use Blue ice mic, which I borrowed from my friend, and its better than having nothing. The quality improved a lot. I record in Garageband (or Audacity sometimes). Brittik made a good intro music and we include it from the 3rd episode onwards. It's a great start to the episodes now. We record in the mornings these days because it's mostly silent and audio is better.\n\nIt's fun to talk about things we love and be able to share it to people. We are looking forward to publish more this year.\n\nI'm really happy to share these stats\n\n![podcast stats](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/0k56jj0cq2lgct3dn24v.png)\n\n# What are you waiting for?\n\nYes you.\n\n~~Go listen to out podcaaasst!

We can use that to make REST calls, get HTML content of a webpage(if we are using node for scraping) and many more things.\n\n> This article is valid for any function that returns a promise.\n\nAn example of such call goes like this\n\n```js\nfetch('/url')\n  .then((res) => res.json())\n  .then((data) => console.log(data));\n```\n\n# The Async way\n\nWe could do the same thing, using async and await.\n\n```js\nconst result = await fetch('/url');\nconst data = await result.json();\n\nconsole.log(data);\n\n// Or, a one-liner\n// const data = await (await fetch('/url')).json(); 😉\n```\n\n# I have so many things to fetch!\n\nOkay fine. We can do that over a classic for loop. The synchronous nature will be preserved. I mean, we can fetch one after the other, synchronously.\n\n```js\nconst urls = [...];\nfor(const url of urls) {\n    const result = await fetch(url);\n    const data = await result.json();\n\n    console.log(data);\n}\n```\n\nBut what if, the order does not matter? We can fetch them all at once. Yes, all at once, using the Promise API. After all, `fetch` returns a promise and that's why we `await` for it to be resolved.\n\nPromise API has this method `Promise.all()` , which can be awaited on for all the promises that it accepts as an argument to be resolved.\n\n```js\nconst urls = [...];\nconst promises = urls.map(url => fetch(url));\n\nawait Promise.all(promises);\n\nfor (const promise of promises) {\n    const data = await promise.json();\n    console.log(data);\n}\n```\n\nThis will save us a lot of time. Imagine we want to parse many webpages, around 100, and each webpage takes 2 seconds to be fetched and scraped for information we need. If we fetch it one after the other, it will take us around 200 seconds, which is over 3 minutes. But if we fetch all at once, it will take under a minute.\n\n# Like, really SO MANY!\n\nWhat is we have over 10000 urls to fetch. If we do the same thing as above, we will most probably not make it. We will have to face some weird socket hangup error. What can we do about it?\n\nThere is a node package called `Bluebird` which has its own Promise API and it functions the same. It has this method called `map`, which takes an extra options argument where we can set concurrency.\n\n`Promise.map(urls => fetch(url), { concurrency: 100 });`\n\nThis will, as we can infer from the line, concurrently fetch 100 requests at a time.

There are 2 parts to it.\n\n- One - creating the pages after fetching from the rest API using `createPage()`\n- Two - creating the node in the GraphQL layer to be able to query in other pages (for example in `index.js` where you list all the pages)\n\nAfter adding that piece of code to `gatsby-node.js` and running `gatsby develop` you will have pages created at the `path` you’ve given to `createPage()`.\n\nTo list them in any other page, we can use a query that looks like this\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  allPost(sort: { order: DESC, fields: date }) {\n    nodes {\n      slug\n      title\n      date\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can experiment with the query in GraphiQL dashboard that runs when you `gatsby develop`.\n\nHope this helps.\n",

Sometimes I work from home when I have to do my daily chores, and sometimes from nearby coffee shops.\n\nI really enjoy that I don't go to **an office** to work every day. Gone are those days when I had to sit at the same place to work (under the nose of my manager) and feel guilty to take a break or spend some time in the cafeteria.\n\nThe days earlier were daunting(in a way) and I did not have time for anything other than work. I used to work my ass off even in the weekends, sometimes. I could not function like this more than 6 months. These were the first 6 months of my day job, and I clearly knew I was getting exhausted. This was not the way to work, for me especially. It even took a toll on my productivity. Zero progress on side-projects or the things I wanted to learn or the books I wanted to read. The to-do lists just kept increasing.\n\n> You cannot function for long without re-fueling yourselves.\n\nI decided to change this. I took up a remote position at an awesome company. They are the best people I've ever worked with. A lot of things, including my lifestyle, have changed lately. I really enjoy the work I do, along with the life I am living.\n\n# Things that I take benefit of\n\n## Flexibility - time 🕰\n\nI don't have to work at strict timings anymore. If I have some other work in the afternoon, I can shift my work timing to the night. If I don't like to work in the day, because of the noise out there, I can become a batman and work at nights.\n\nOur team is remote. The main pro, and also a con, of a completely remote team is **availability**. But, when well managed, this is not such a problem. When you know, who will be available at what time and when to expect replies, you can adapt to the routine. I use [There app](https://there.pm) to keep track of the different time zones my colleagues are in.\n\n## Flexibility - location 🏕\n\nNo office to go to. I go to a co working space in the city centre and work from there. I could not function alone from home for more than a month. I go to that space to have some people around. I met some amazing people there. Co-working spaces have have diverse people. From startup founders to designers to architects I've met them all. Its good to talk to them about the work they do and listen to the problems they face.\n\n![an image of co working space](workspace.jpeg)\n\nI visit my family often. I go home during some weekends and extend my stay there for few days.\n\nI work from coffee shops if I need some change and I am getting to like it. I am planning to do it more often. I get more work done in a coffee shop. Maybe the aroma makes me more productive. 😉\n\n(Also, I can wear anything I want.)\n\nTravelling to other cities has been on my checklist from long ago and I will check that off soon. I plan to stay in another city for a month.\n\n## Free time\n\nI can now attend conferences and speak at meetups. I learned a lot by attending conferences and events. I should start writing and publishing about those experiences too.\n\n![aravind balla talk seminar about react](talk.jpg)\n\nAlso, I love sharing the things I've learnt, so I speak at few meetups.\n\n> Those who know, do. Those who understand, teach.\n\nNot only this, I now have time for hobbies. I have been learning [German](https://www.duolingo.com/aravindballa) and I am loving it. _Vershest du Duestch?_\n\nI read books in the evening sometimes. This year, I want to do it more. One book a month is the goal. This is the progress till now - [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35045477-aravind-balla).\n\nI find myself pull out a notebook and practicing hand lettering sometimes. A complete beginner though.\n\n![beginner hand lettering picture](art.jpeg)\n\nAll these things are helping me unwind after work and being in track. Productivity and the quality of work I do has improved a lot. I am learning great things at my job and it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to be.\n\n# So...\n\nI encourage you to introspect and see where is your life taking you to and where do you want to be. Change things that you are not happy with and I hope this post helps you (a little bit) in doing so.\n",

A Gatsby site can be built from an API or just with some data from a JSON file.\n\n> You don't need GraphQL.\n\nIf you don't know what [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is, it is a static site generator built in React. You can use React to build the components of the website and give them to Gatsby, which will then generate a blazing fast website for you.\n\nIf you are interested in building it from an API, [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/using-gatsby-without-graphql/) is a well demonstrated example.\n\nIf most of you site is static and only certain part of it changes, why would you need GraphQL to fetch things.\n\nLet us build a site from just a JSON file which contains some data.\n\n# Let's Start\n\nStep One is to clone the `hello-world-starter` and make sure everything works.\n\n```bash\nnpx gatsby new hello-world https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world\ncd hello-world\nyarn develop\n```\n\nNow, `http://localhost:8000` should say, \"hello world!\".\n\n# Adding the data\n\nAdd a JSON file at `content/data.json` which has information on the pages. The path is just a personal preference ;)\n\n```javascript\n// content/data.json\n{\n  \"pages\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"About\",\n      \"slug\": \"about\",\n      \"paragraphs\": [\n        {\n          \"heading\": \"Work\",\n          \"content\": \"Works as a Javascript Enginneer. Has experience with Gatsby, React, Javascript, Node, Mongo and a little Python as well\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Talks\",\n      \"slug\": \"talks\",\n      \"paragraphs\": [\n        {\n          \"heading\": \"Building A Progressive Web App\",\n          \"content\": \"PWA (Progre...\"\n        },\n        ...\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n# Template to render the Page\n\nNext, we create a template which will get the data from the JSON and render it to the webpage.\n\n```javascript\n// src/templates/page.js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst PageTemplate = (props) => {\n  const { title = null, paragraphs = null } = props.pageContext;\n\n  return (\n    <React.Fragment>\n      {title && <h1>{title}</h1>}\n      {paragraphs &&\n        paragraphs.map((para) => (\n          <div>\n            <h2>{para.heading}</h2>\n            <p>{para.content}</p>\n          </div>\n        ))}\n    </React.Fragment>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default PageTemplate;\n```\n\nA very naive and basic React component which gets `title` and `paragraphs` in the `pageContext` and it renders them. We will get to how the data is passed to `pageContext` in a while.\n\n# Create the Pages now!\n\nHow do we tell Gatsby what pages it should create? By creating `gatsby-node.js`!\n\n```javascript\n// gatsby-node.js\nconst path = require(`path`);\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nexports.createPages = ({ actions }) => {\n  const { createPage } = actions;\n\n  const pageData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./content/data.json', { encoding: 'utf-8' }));\n  const blogPostTemplate = path.resolve(`src/templates/page.js`);\n\n  pageData.pages.forEach((page) => {\n    createPage({\n      path: page.slug,\n      component: blogPostTemplate,\n      context: {\n        ...page,\n      },\n    });\n  });\n};\n```\n\nHere, we use `createPages()` API, where we loop through all the pages from the JSON data, and call `createPage()` action to create the actual page. Here we pass the template(which is component) and the URL(path) where the page has to be generated. The actual data is passed as `context`. This is the context that we use in our Page template to populate the data.\n\n# Run\n\nBoom! It actually works of you have used `yarn develop`. It hot reloads every change you make. Now you can navigate to `http://localhost:8000/talks` and `/about` pages and see how they look (and feel good about yourself).\n\nYou realise the potential of Gatsby, right? Possibilities are limitless. In this case, you just have to add styles and you have a portfolio site.\n\nThanks for reading through.\n\nKeep on hacking!\n",

You spend some time figuring out things as you don't have endless money to get a task\n  done.\n</Toggle>\n\nMy priorities for the dream newsletter service are these\n\n- Great writing experience or just plain Markdown works\n- API for adding subscribers as I like to have custom forms on my blog (like the one at the bottom of this page)\n- Analytics telling me how many people opened\n- Free of cost or costs little (too much to ask?)\n\nOne thing that gets close to those is [Mailbluster](https://mailbluster.com/), which uses your own SES credentials to send emails, so it's very cheap.\nThe editor is bad though.\nAnd there is no API.\n\nEven if I build a simple markdown to html-email generator (which I did in the past), I have to open Mailbluster and send the emails.\n\n## Enter, Ghost\n\n[Ghost](https://ghost.org) is a great publishing platform.\nThe editor is best in class.\nLike Notion.\n\nNot just that, it can send really nice emails to the subscribers.\n\n**Here is the good part** - If you self host it, you can have unlimited subscribers and send as many email you'd like with Mailgun account.\n\nMailgun is almost free.\nAfter first 1000 free emails, other 1000 cost 1$ in that month.\n\nSo the upsides with Ghost\n\n- Great writing experience\n- Unlimited subscribers\n- Unlimited emails\n- Costs less for the emails and for the hosting\n- Also, I can have multiple different newsletters (for future)\n\n## Where do we host it, though?\n\nRemember I'm not using this a blog or personal portfolio.\nJust for sending newsletters.\n\nIt doesn't have to be fast and no visitors on the site, as I'm using it only for sending newsletters.\nIt is only me using the app and the emails get routed though Mailgun anyways.\nSo a cheap server works.\n\nI'd say you can do it just on your laptop or a home server. Railway is a good choice if you want it to be available everywhere.\n\nOr, a service which lets you host it for free, like [Digital Press](https://www.digitalpress.blog/).\nTheir free plan puts ads on your content, but guess what - I don't publish content, just send emails.\n\nWe now have something that costs almost nothing, with great upsides.\n\nWill I use it?

        "body": {
          "raw": "\nYou are probably not starting a new project with React in the frontend. You just want to build some components, make use of the apis that your frontend already consumes and use them in your existing application.\n\nAwesome! You can always do that. Let me outline the workflow here.\n\nTake the built output js file and include it your HTML(application). You would need to add React and ReactDOM to the HTML to mount the components on to the page.\n\n```javascript\nclass WelcomeComp extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { name: '' };\n    if (props.name) this.state = { name: props.name };\n  }\n\n  updateName = (name) => this.setState({ name });\n\n  render() {\n    return <p>I am a React Component. Hello {this.state.name}</p>;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe transpiled version of the above code is most probably the output you would be getting from build system. (Webpack isn’t mandatory. You can use gulp or grunt if you development is setup using them.)\n\nNext up is including things in your application. I am including directly into HTML.\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Sandbox</title>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <script src=\"<https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.production.min.js>\"></script>\n    <script src=\"<https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.production.min.js>\"></script>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\"></div>\n    <div id=\"root\"></div>\n\n    <script src=\"build/existing.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"build/WelcomeComp.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n      var rootEl = document.getElementById('root');\n      ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(WelcomeComp, null, null), rootEl);\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis would mount the component to the root div. Remember you cannot use JSX here as the script in HTML has a type `text/javascript`. So we used `React.createElement()` instead of `<WelcomeComp />`.\n\n### The issue\n\nBut how would your Component communicate with the existing application? You could be fetching and sending requests from the component itself. Which would need some React code, that isn’t an issue. But in some cases, you need the component to sync up with existing stores in your application.\n\nMaybe you have an ExtJS store or a RxJS store, maybe a MobX one. How do you sync the component with it? 🤔\n\n### React ref to our rescue\n\nYou can pass a reference to the component and store it as a local variable in the code. All the methods in the React Component can be accessed through those refs. Don’t quite get it? Here is the code.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var rootEl = document.getElementById('root');\n  var componentProps = {\n    name: 'Balla',\n    ref: function (ref) {\n      this.welcomeComp = ref;\n    },\n  };\n  ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(WelcomeComp, componentProps, null), rootEl);\n\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    this.welcomeComp.updateName('Aravind');\n  }, 2000);\n</script>\n```\n\nSyncing is easy now.

And it waits for the update to show up until,\ntill the result calculation is not finished. Fibonacci for large numbers is expensive.\nIt even freezes your browser tab if the input is long.\n\nDo we have a solution to this? Can we some how **off-load** this computation from the main thread?\n_(Why is he talking about threads in javascript?)_\n\n## Web Workers\n\nWeb workers act as threads which are handled/processed by our browser. We can start a worker as a thread and communicate with it in a particular way. React is after all Javascript UI library, and we are running it in the browser, so why not?\n\nThis is the worker, which has to be statically served. (Put in `public` folder)\n\n```javascript\n// thread.worker.js\nconst fib = (i) => (i <= 1 ? i : fib(i - 1) + fib(i - 2));\n\nself.addEventListener('message', ({ data }) => {\n  let { type, payload } = data;\n  if (type === 'UPDATE') {\n    payload = payload > 11 ? 11 : payload; // upper limit we set\n    const result = fib(payload * 5);\n    self.postMessage({ type: 'UPDATE_SUCCESS', payload: result });\n  }\n});\n\nself.addEventListener(\n  'exit',\n  () => {\n    process.exit(0);\n  },\n  false\n);\n```\n\nWe communicate with the worker using events. Look at the code here, we are listening 👂 to `message` events. We process the data according to `type` passed and return the result as a message.\n\nIf you can guess right, we will have to listen to these messages from the worker in our component. Our component goes like this.\n\n```javascript\n// App.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\nimport './styles.css';\n\nconst worker = new Worker('/thread.worker.js');\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');\n  const [length, setLength] = React.useState(0);\n\n  // when mount and unmount\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    const listener = ({ data: { type, payload } }) => {\n      console.log(type, payload);\n      if (type === 'UPDATE_SUCCESS') setLength(payload);\n    };\n    worker.addEventListener('message', listener);\n    return () => worker.removeEventListener('message', listener);\n  }, []);\n\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    worker.postMessage({ type: 'UPDATE', payload: value.length });\n  }, [value]);\n\n  const handleChange = async (e) => {\n    const { value } = e.target;\n    setValue(value);\n  };\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>\n      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>\n      <input value={value} onChange={handleChange} />\n      <p>{length}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById('root');\nReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);\n```\n\nIf you are using Webpack, you can load it into your component with `worker-loader!thread.js`. We are directly using `Worker()` to load it from the `public` directory.\n\nHere is the codesandbox demo - [https://codesandbox.io/s/funny-nightingale-5kxo1](https://codesandbox.io/s/funny-nightingale-5kxo1)\n\n> Here is the [Effect Hook documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) for reference.\n\nWe are adding the listeners for the messages in the **first effect**, where the dependencies are `[]`, which means this will [run](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#tip-optimizing-performance-by-skipping-effects) when the component is mounting and unmounting.\n\nAnd in the **second effect**, we send a message to the worker whenever the value changes.\n\nWe can see a huge performance bump with workers when we compare it to the first demo. The load is taken up by the browser now.\n\nThat's how you can use web workers in React. Thanks for reading!\n\nKeep on Hacking! ✌\n",

Message Aravind on Twitter if you want to know or talk more about this.\n\n## Save Tweets for later\n\nLet’s look at a shortcut which **adds a Tweet to my ToDo app**. _Why? You have bookmarks in Twitter, right? — you may ask._ I don’t want to use bookmarks for tweets that I just want to have a look later, and not save them. So, it’s helpful if I just add to my ToDo app which I can check off after having a look at it. And to do this, we would have to copy the tweet’s URL, open the ToDo app, and paste it. But with shortcuts, I can just share the tweet to the shortcut from the share menu, and it gets added.\n\n## Properly turn off WiFi\n\niOS doesn’t turn off the WiFi completely when you pull the menu from top-right, it just `Disables it till tomorrow`. This is frustrating. I would expect it to turn off when I turn it off. I use a Shortcut as a work around here. I can turn off WiFi completely from there.\n\n## What did I tweet?\n\nMany a times, I want to look at my tweets about a topic. I can use Twitter search for it — `from:aravindballa search-string`. But when I want to lookup when I’m drafting a tweet, I have to save tweet as a draft and search it in the app. Instead, I have a Shortcut which prompts me to enter a string, and then opens Safari page with the search results. This lets me easily look at past tweets and copy the URL if I want to link it.\n\n## What’s playing?\n\nI collect songs interesting songs on the go from places like cafes and restaurants. Some play cool music. I look up on Shazam for the song and save it to a playlist in Apple Music. That takes a few clicks. But with Shortcuts, one tap and the song gets added to a playlist.\n\n## Custom icons on iPhone Home screen\n\nThere was a wave of people doing funky things with their home screens when someone found out you can have custom icons for apps using shortcuts. Mainly because you couldn’t do those kind of customizations on iOS earlier . Few made a lot of money selling icon packs. Mine is minimal.\n\n## Notes on the fly\n\nI use Drafts to take quick notes when in a rush. It automatically syncs to other devices. And it opens a fresh new note whenever I open the app. It’s purely for quick notes and first drafts. And when in a rush, we can just dictate a note using shortcuts, without even opening the app. All the shortcuts can be run using Siri. _Hey Siri, dictate note_ and the note gets recorded and saved as text in Drafts. You can use any other note taking app for that matter, if it supports Shortcuts, not just Drafts.\n",
