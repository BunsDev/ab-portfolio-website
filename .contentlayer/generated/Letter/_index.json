This is the very first email I'm sending out on my newsletter and I can't wait to hear from you.\n\n---\n\n## Over optimization yields zero results\n\n> A wood cutter who only sharps his axe doesn't make a dime.\n>\n> – Aravind\n\nWe are generally obsessed with optimizing every part of our lives. In my case, I want the perfect setup to write blogs. I’ve been working on this for weeks trying different setups and apps for writings. I dreamed of a writing setup where I would write on the iPad and it automatically gets built and deployed to my website. I went through [setups](https://francescodilorenzo.com/blog-setup) of people who did this. **But you can only get inspired by other setups as they generally don’t fit perfectly in your routine.**\n\nInstead of doing that, I could have written more than 5 articles if I shifted my focus and energy to producing instead of optimizing. I finally ditched it and move back to [writing markdown in my website’s repository](/writings/perfect-writing-setup/) which then gets built and deployed. This might not be the most efficient, but this allows me produce content faster without thinking/figuring out much.\n\nSimilar thing happened with this newsletter. I wanted to start one back in January. But then, I spent a lot of time researching on various options, trying to build tools that allow me to get the dream setup. At least here I’m happy that I have a working setup to send newsletters to subscribers. Reply to this mail if you'd like to learn more about the setup.\n\nSo the moral of the story is try producing content first and then optimize instead of doing it the other way. It doesn’t make sense to think about an edge case which has very less probability of occuring.\n\n---\n\nThis is an article I'm working on and soon will publish on [my blog](/writings/). But I'm curious to hear back from you. What do think? Have you tried to optimize before doing something?\n\nHave a good week ahead 🔥\n\nAravind\n",

    "body": {
      "raw": "\nHello,\n\nHow's it going? Let's talk about [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) on iOS.\n\niOS shortcuts are a game changer. It was one of the reasons I bought an iPhone. _(Well, at least I feel good when I think like that)_\n\nIf there is a task that takes opening up a few apps and clicking buttons in it, it can be done with a single click using Shortcuts. It’s crazy.\n\n## Save Tweets for later\n\nLet’s look at a shortcut which **adds a Tweet to my To Do app**. _Why? You have bookmarks in Twitter, right? — you may ask._ I don’t want to use bookmarks for tweets that I just want to have a look later, and not save them. So, it’s helpful if I just add to my To Do app which I can check off after having a look at it. And to do this, we would have to copy the tweet’s URL, open the To Do app, and paste it. But with shortcuts, I can just share the tweet to the shortcut from the share menu, and it gets added.\n\n## What did I tweet?\n\nMany a times, I want to look at my tweets about a topic. I can use Twitter search for it — `from:aravindballa search-string`. But when I want to lookup when I’m drafting a tweet, I have to save tweet as a draft and search it in the app. Instead, I have a Shortcut which prompts me to enter a string, and then opens Safari page with the search results. This lets me easily look at past tweets and copy the URL if I want to link it.\n\n## What’s playing?\n\nI collect songs interesting songs on the go from places like cafes and restaurants. Some play cool music. I look up on Shazam for the song and save it to a playlist in Apple Music. That takes a few clicks. But with Shortcuts, one tap and the song gets added to a playlist.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/aravindballa/status/1354698318018793476\n\n## Custom icons on iPhone Home screen\n\nThere was a wave of people doing funky things with their home screens when someone found out you can have custom icons for apps using shortcuts. Mainly because you couldn’t do those kind of customizations on iOS earlier . Few made a lot of money selling icon packs. Mine is minimal.\n\n<div class=\"w-64\">\n\n![img](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EufXErHVEAgPhSb?format=jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nMore shortcuts will be added for the blog post that I'm still writing. This is an excerpt from it. I'll let you know once that post is out. I have a [tweet thread on few Shortcuts I use](https://twitter.com/aravindballa/status/1374378152550494223).\n\nI've also changed my complete knowledge consumption workflow with the help of Shortcuts. Now they help me take notes better on blog posts, tweet threads and stuff. I will tweet once I make few demo videos of it.\n\nIf you are on iOS and would like to try out any of the shortcuts, reply or DM on Twitter and I'd be happy to share.\n\nBrittik and I recorded an episode on Shortcuts for the [Learning Curve Pod](https://learningcurve.dev/). Here is the ep if you want to give a listen - https://learningcurve.dev/21-i-os-shortcuts-we-use\n\n---\n\n## Learning Curve update\n\nWe've recorded 3 episodes in the last week. Looks like we are on a role here! I think we are on a good setup to record episodes. We use this tool called [Zencastr](https://zencastr.com) which helps us to get on a call, and record ourselves. The recording happens locally on our machines and it gets backup to their cloud. After we finish, we download both the videos, his and mine, then off to the post processing.\n\nWe like this. And will release those episodes weekly. To tease what's coming next, Brittik and I are doing intermittent fasts (16:8). We want to record an episode on out experience doing this and what we've learnt.\n\nReleased today - https://open.spotify.com/episode/1qjrm0tE4PTekohla09ZRd?si=eQRPevoeToCno47CnS09hA\n\n---\n\n## Interesting reads\n\n- https://www.nirandfar.com/todo-vs-schedule-builder/\n- https://twitter.com/chris_herd/status/1375429865281875976\n\n---\n\nPhew, this was a long write up.

And it doesn't make sense to record the non interesting parts, or parts where a lot of manual work is involved instead of creative work. There is one video yet to be edited where I set up themes (dark & light) using Tailwind CSS. I worked on the parts where I had to fill up the content from my old website. And I'll record more videos when I start working on interesting things like `/bookshelf` page, page views counter, etc.\n\nA few notes from the commits I pushed recently\n\n**Images were hard**. Especially because I was coming from Gatsby where the images are local entities. With `next/image` and `next-mdx-loader`, they either should be in the public directory, or should come from an external url. But I have them locally in directories. file-loader came to the rescue.\n\nI'm also thinking of moving the images out of the repository to a cloud like S3 or Cloudinary.\n\nHere is how I used **Web fonts** for the best font loading performance.\n\n- Add the font files locally (in public folder). No Google Fonts link as the edge cache is more performant\n- Set cache headers to let Vercel cache it on the edge\n- Preload them using `<link />`\n- `font-display: optional`\n\nI added `next-seo` to the website and it was a bliss to work with. All the articles now have JSON-LD schema and I copied over the open graph images from my previous setup which work on top of Cloudinary transformations. **SEO gains!**\n\nThis is an example open graph image. Source - https://images.balla.dev/upload/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,q_auto,f_auto/w_984,c_fit,co_rgb:ffffff,g_north_west,x_108,y_87,l_text:Poppins_64_bold:Hackletter/card\n\n![](https://images.balla.dev/upload/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,q_auto,f_auto/w_984,c_fit,co_rgb:ffffff,g_north_west,x_108,y_87,l_text:Poppins_64_bold:Hackletter/card)\n\nThe setup works like this - There is a base image in Cloudinary. It adds the text based on the URL parameters dynamically. The custom url (images.balla.dev) is a Cloudflare proxy which caches the image generated by Cloudinary.\n\n_Lots of clouds, 😅_\n\n**RSS** is generated as a prebuild step. It is a node script which gets all the MD(X) files and generates RSS. I've decided not to include the complete content in the feed as I would have few custom components that would need JS to work in the future.\n\nhttps://github.com/aravindballa/website/blob/master/scripts/generateRSS.js\n\nIf you'd like to see the preview of what's going on here is the link - [https://website-indol-pi.vercel.app/](https://website-indol-pi.vercel.app/)\n\nThat's all for this Tuesday.\n\nStay safe.\n",

Plugins in VS Code for example. We have plugins that help us format code, run some linting checks, change the colours (themes) etc.\n\nSimilarly, note taking tools have options to customize too. Like Obsidian and Roam. You’d need some technical knowledge here but that shouldn’t stop you.\n\nI’ve built a Roam plugin recently that helps me summarize entries from [my Interstitial journal](https://twitter.com/aravindballa/status/1391651468499853312?s=20) and reports the time I spent on each project in that week. This helps me exponentially while planning my weeks. I can now have an estimate on how much time I can spend doing things in a week which helps me set realistic goals for the next week and say no to things that don’t matter.\n\n![roam plugin demo](https://res.cloudinary.com/djeivq7td/image/upload/w_600/v1621306221/HL/roam-plugin-demo.png)\n\nOften times, we don’t realise we can actually customize or change the set actions we perform to finish repetitive tasks. Even if the tool we use doesn’t provide plugins, we can examine **if some part of the workflow can be simplified**.\n\nFor example, you found an interesting thread on Twitter. You now want to copy it your note taking tool and make notes on it. You can use some sort of a shortcut (iOS) or a thread reader app which unrolls the complete thread and problem is partially solved. And you’ve simplified this for yourself every time you want to copy tweet threads.\nI’ve [built a iOS shortcut](https://twitter.com/aravindballa/status/1373671116154150914) for this. I share the tweet to the shortcut and it copies the complete thread to my clipboard.\nFrom the experience of building these things, I’ve realized there is one key thing that I follow which is working with half knowledge.\n\n**You don’t need to know everything**. You can figure things out on your way. Keep what you want to achieve in mind.\n\nOn a similar note, I've recorded a 9 minute audio with [Reddy](https://twitter.com/reddy2go) on this topic. 👉 [customising, tailor-making and playing with products, apps & services](https://racket.com/reddy2go/re22y)\n\nClosing thoughts - Don’t settle with the current power of the tools.

If you haven’t read it yet, I highly recommend getting a copy. It’s short\none packed with gold. I couldn’t resist taking notes while reading the book. These are my takeaways from it.\n\n### Share your journey\n\nWe generally have the tendency to share things when we release something. We announce when we are done. But then, that announcement, on social media, doesn’t get the reach and engagement we wanted to have.\n\nIn comparison, imagine you were tweeting about what you are building at every small win. These series of tweets are capable of reaching more eyes. And people who resonate will stick around.\nPeople connect with the stories. Not just success stories, but also failure ones. Tell how you failed. And what you learned from it. Stories make us human.\n\n> But human beings are interested in other human beings and what other human beings do.\n\n### Be discoverable\n\n> But it’s not enough to be good. In order to be found, you have to be findable.\n\nThis is the key #1 takeaway for me. How will anyone find out about you if are not discoverable. Put yourself out there.\n\nHow? 👇\n\n### Teach what you know\n\n> Teaching people doesn’t subtract value from what you do, it actually adds to it. When you teach someone how to do your work, you are, in effect, generating more interest in your work.\n\nPeople feel closer to your work when you let them know how it's done. You grow more as a community, than as an individual who is working by keeping their methods as a secret.\n\nWhen one teaches, two learn. The person you are teaching and you.\n\nWhen you try explaining to others, that topic gets clarified in your head as well. In turn, you will be developing a strong understanding of that topic.\n\nDon’t assume what you know is obvious and think that others would know it as well.\n\n---\n\nThat’s all for this letter. I have a lengthy notes on this one and will post a complete summary on my blog later.\n\nThanks reading and I’d appreciate if you share this with your friends if you think they’ll enjoy too.

      "raw": "\n_Hi, I’m Aravind Balla and you are reading letter 12 from the Hackletter where I talk about my learnings and give you behind the scenes of things I keep doing for fun._\n\nI recently built a corner on my website with the details of the books I read on Kindle and the highlights I take while reading them. I call it – [Bookshelf](https://aravindballa.com/bookshelf/). _What else would I?_. Thanks to modern technology, the website updated automatically while I keep reading and I don't have to push a button.\n\nI want to talk about how I did that in this letter.\n\n## Secret sauce 🍅\n\nReadwise plays a huge role here. Readwise is a service that syncs your highlights and notes from a lot of sources. Kindle happens to be a popular and the most used source (for me). In this case, Readwise is responsible for getting all the highlights and the book details into my digital bookshelf.\n\nI make API calls to Readwise with my API token and fetch all the details I need to show on my bookshelf.\n\nReadwise referral if you'd like to try it - [https://readwise.io/i/aravind1](https://readwise.io/i/aravind1)\n\n## How does it automatically update, though?\n\nMy website is basically a bunch of static pages. And I use NextJS, a framework based on ReactJS to generate those static pages. It's powerful. Let me tell you how.\n\nIt has a cool feature called Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), which allows a particular page on the website to **rebuilt on the fly** to be always upto-date. When someone visits the page, it tries to rebuild the page on its servers to check for new content.\n\nThe interesting advantage I get here is – if this new build fails for some reason, like API spec changes or API doesn't work anymore, I still have the old page live. Nothing is lost and there is no downtime.\n\nAll the pages in the bookshelf are ISR enabled, so they stay updated, always.\n\n## Hiccups ⏹\n\nIt wasn't a complete cake walk, at least while deploying. Readwise's API has a rate limit. We can only fetch the data, highlights or the book details, certain times in a minute. As my website was statically generated, it tried to fetch highlights for all the books while building the site and deploying. It would always fail.\n\nHow did I solve it? _By not building the book pages (the one's with highlights)._\n\nThis is another area where NextJS shines. I can ask it to build the pages when the user visits and not build it at the time of deployment. If the page is not yet built, it builds it. If it is already built, it serves it from the cache. As it is deployed on an [Edge network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching), there are copies of the cache across the world and pages are served very fast to the users. This is some sort of delayed static site generation.\n\nThe code is completely **opensource** - [https://github.com/aravindballa/website/tree/master/pages/bookshelf](https://github.com/aravindballa/website/tree/master/pages/bookshelf)\n\n## What's in for the future\n\nI would like to add my takes on the highlights and write full length summaries from the notes I take while reading the books.\n\n_And what about physical books?_ I don't know yet. I'm sure I can add the books manually to\n\nReadwise and add highlights using the OCR feature of their mobile app. I will have opinions when I try this.\n\nAudio books? No idea, as well.\n\n---\n\nThanks reading and I’d appreciate if you reply and let me know what you think about this. I'd love some feedback and suggestions. Share this with your friends if you think they’ll enjoy too.

      "raw": "\n_Hi, I’m Aravind Balla and you are reading letter 13 from the Hackletter where I talk about my learnings and give you behind the scenes of things I keep doing for fun._\n\nI was a curious kid in college. I still am. I always want to find solutions to the issues I face. _Only if I solved them all, my life would be at peace already._\n\nWe were learning IoT back in those days and we were asked to build a project using the skills we've learned.\n\nI did something interesting there. Instead of looking for projects to do, I looked for **problems that I can solve**. \"How can I use these skills I gained to solve something that's been troubling me?\", I wondered.\n\n[IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) is an interesting technology which makes the devices around us, like plugs and bulbs smart.\n\nWhen I looked for things I wanted to solve, I realized that the way I charge my phone (over-night) is harmful for its battery. So I thought, \"Why don't I turn off the charger after it finished charging\". I looked for a way to get the plug/socket switch off based on some signal. Soon I learnt, it was possible if I hook up [Arduino and a software relay](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-relay).\n\nI learned how to use a bluetooth module with the Arduino to enable communication to the phone so that it knows when to turn off. And then I built an Android app which sends a signal to Arduino when it is charged up to 99%.\n\nSolved!\n\nDid I solve this purely with the learnt about IoT? _No_\n\nBefore doing this, I didn't know how to integrate bluetooth to Arduino, I just knew the basics of Android. Nothing about bluetooth or reading your phone's battery. I learned on the way and patched up things to make it work. Just in time learning.\n\n![half knowledge art](https://res.cloudinary.com/djeivq7td/image/upload/v1623728983/HL/half-knowledge-art.jpg)\n\nLearn to do things with half knowledge. Don't fool yourself thinking you need to know everything before you start. It's the schooling that made us believe we should know it all.

And if you are looking to start your own, this isn’t probably the advice you should look at.\n\nThis is a custom tailored process that I like doing. I like adding a custom flair to the things I make or publish.\n\n### Writing ✍️\n\nAll the writing happens in Roam Research (or Obsidian as I'm juggling between the two). I add ideas to my daily notes whenever they pop up in my head. With a tag hl-inbox so I can filter them later on a page dedicated to newsletter when I sit to write. The key here is **writing down that idea as soon as it pops up**.\n\nI set aside time to write scheduled in my calendar, generally 9am to 10am everyday. As of writing this, the time is, 09:18.\n\n### Building the email 👨‍🔧\n\nThen I copy the content over to a markdown file and generate custom HTML email using a framework called [maizzlejs](https://maizzle.com/).\n\nNothing fancy, but this adds the fonts and colours I like. Makes it a little responsive. I get to use TailwindCSS for the styles, so its cool.\n\n### Sending the email 📮\n\nI use a service called [Mailbluster](https://mailbluster.com/) to send out this HTML email to subscribers. What’s cool about this is it uses SES to the send the mails, which means it very cost effective.\n\nMailbluster lets me manage my subscribers create lists and send campaigns.\n\nIt also has an API which I use to collect emails from my website/landing page. One extra cool thing - I send myself a Telegram notification whenever someone signs up. It’s lights up a smile on my face when I see it.\n\n> Is all of that required? Heck no.\n> Is it fun?

Both of them didn't happen. I had to cancel my trek in the last minute because of few emergencies.\n\nNow on to this week's letter...\n\n## Calendar > Todolists\n\nI say this because calendars let you decide when you want to do that particular task, right when you enter it into your system.\n\n**Todo lists are great for a brain dump**, meaning – getting all the tasks out of your head into a list that can be managed later. And that later never comes. You will feel less overwhelmed after getting the tasks out. _Or more? Because now you have a huge list._\n\nThis doesn't make sure the task gets done. I know the apps these days allow you to schedule and add due dates to the tasks. But then it misses the context of how your day is, what meetings you have and at what times you are free.\n\nCalendars solve this exact problem. **You can schedule when you want to actually strike that task off, and follow it when the time comes.** All your meetings are in it already. Schedule time blocks and tell yourself you'll not get distracted during that time block. Do it.\n\n_But, what about tasks that are not scheduled and I want to do them some day when I feel like?_\n\nTodo lists. Yeah. Calendars are for things you want to get done.\n\nMy todo lists have only grown in size over the years. A lot of the tasks aren't relavant any more. This happened because I never went back to them and reviewed or scheduled or archived. **Review is a crucial part of any system that you want to stick to for longer.**\n\nThe best way, one that works for me, is to use both todo list and a calendar. Every week, I sort out the tasks I want to complete. I schedule few rough time blocks in the calendar for my week. And every morning after I write my morning pages, I schedule my day with things I want to get done.\n\n## Extra Resources\n\nThis is a video from Francesco, host of Keep Productive, explaining how he uses Todoist along side Google Calendar.\n\n[![YT Video](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iZomby5RNgA/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNAFEJQDSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCiauo9C9eZT24jDo7X1hsoAvPPrA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZomby5RNgA)\n\n---\n\nWhat do you think of this rant?

Side projects quickly start demanding more and more time from you. They never finish in a weekend.\n\nBut I think I've figured out a balance between side projects and day job, which works for me.

Always. And you don't know when a good idea strikes. Usually it is at unexpected times. While you poop, or sometimes when you are working on a completely different thing.\n\n**Combinatory Play** . This term is coined by Einstein, which means, The act of opening up one mental channel by dabbling in another. Sometimes when he is struck with a Math problem, he would go play some music (violin). This would let his mind open up to new solutions when he comes back to that original problem.\n\n_Not completely related, but you get the point._ I just want to tell you that the brain is crazy.\nHaving note taking app always open helps me jot down an idea quickly and not let that go. I jot down and forget about it.\n\nI have a scheduled block in my calendar where I plan the project. In that time block, I go through all the notes, create a task spec to work on and prioritize things for the project.\n\nA lot of ideas are discarded here as well. It feels like a great idea when you get it, but it wears off over time. So this also acts as an idea incubator where I pick worthy ideas after giving them some time to marinate.\n\n## Laser down on the task at hand\n\nFind time to actually work on the project is hard. Especially when you have a day job.\n\nWhat helped me here is scheduling time before hand. While planning the week, which I try to do often, I schedule some blocks early in the morning, some times at night to work on the project.\nSome Saturdays, I have the complete day for myself to work on it.\n\n**Not burning out** is an important aspect to consider if you are playing the long game. So I don't work on it always.\n\nNow when the time comes, I protect it by minimizing all the possible distractions and focus on the planned stuff.\n\nBoth the above things I talked about go hand in hand. If I don't plan properly, I will have to work on not-so-important stuff for the project. If I don't focus while working, I don't push the project forward.\n\nThis is what I'm experimenting with these days. Please let me know your thoughts on this my replying. And if you are wondering what side project this is, it's [Stackblocks](https://stackblocks.app).\n\nAnd if this interests you and want me to talk more about the behind the scenes of building stuff, let me know.\n\nHave a good time of the day.\n\nSee you next Tuesday 👋\n\n_Thanks for reading.
