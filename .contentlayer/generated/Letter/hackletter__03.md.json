But there are a few obstacles, bottlenecks as I call them here, in my way of getting to do what I want.\n\nEveryone has a common bottleneck, **time**. But the thing is, everyone has the same amount of time in a day. How can you create more time? By **saying no** to almost everything. This would help me to focus on the task at hand.\n\nAnother bottleneck is our **mental health**. Taking right breaks and being healthy is important to be able to make the most of your time. How does it help, when you have a free day, where you can work on the thing you want, but you are mentally drained. You aren't able to concentrate on anything. Waste, right?\n\nThink of the bottlenecks that are in the way for achieving what you want to do.\n\nCan you think of any more examples?\n\n## Interesting finds\n\nAlong with links to interesting content, I've added few notes I took while reading them.
