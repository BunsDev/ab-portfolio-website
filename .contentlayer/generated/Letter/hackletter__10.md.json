There are a few things I like and some work still pending. Well, it says it is in Beta, so we can expect few things undone.\n\n## You don't need a paid plan.\n\nThey've give access to the API for free accounts as well. That's really cool, and everyone gets to try it out. They will be putting limits to the API usage though. Pro plans get more access and will have higher limits.\n\n## What is it ready for?\n\nWriting to database (like tables) and pages works well. And that actually opens up a lot of possibilities. [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/notion/integrations) and [n8n](https://n8n.io/) have already started supporting the Notion API.\n\nI could quickly hack together a small script which saves the number of visits for each page to a table in Notion last weekend.\n\nSome thing like this\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Faravindballa%2Fxq9ii18Zgv.png?alt=media&token=187177c0-83b1-46b9-83d9-5b952a6eef8b)\n\nTweet with demo video - [https://twitter.com/aravindballa/status/1393108375777386501](https://twitter.com/aravindballa/status/1393108375777386501)\n\nI wanted to extend that to make a full fledge analytics tool powered by Notion. I thought I was unsuccessful, but an idea struck after I tweeted about this. [Link to complete thread](https://twitter.com/aravindballa/status/1396899425587367940)\n\n_It's funny how you get ideas when you explain why something might not work._\n\n## Major missing part\n\nWe cannot get the content of all the blocks yet. Text is completely supported, like headings, bulleted lists, etc. But the images aren't. And I guess other complex blocks don't as well.\n\nSo retrieving the complete content of a page is difficult.\n\nBut thanks to open source, we an alternative to fetching all the blocks which has been working from long, even before the release of this API - [notion-client](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x/tree/master/packages/notion-client).\n\nLet me know if you have any plan's with the Notion API. I'd love to talk about it.\n\nThat's all for this Tuesday.\n\nSee you in a week. ðŸ‘‹\n",
