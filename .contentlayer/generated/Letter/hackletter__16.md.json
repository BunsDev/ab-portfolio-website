Working on the right things is. Even if you don't work long hours, when you choose to work on things that are essential, you move close to your goals.\n\nI now plan my weeks. I think about what has to be done in the week so that I get a little close to my goals. If I don't plan things, I keep working on random things that come to me. It's like **moving but not in the right direction**. Planning helps me get that **direction right**.\n\nSaying No is an important skill. It creates time. When you plan stuff, you will not be able to say yes everything that comes your way. Because you know it can't be fitted in your schedule.\n\n## 2 essential parts - Zoom out and Zoom in\n\nZooming in the work you put in and zooming out is finding out what you want to work on. Both are important.\n\nI suggest you create a new note or take a piece of paper, and write down what you want to achieve this week. Zoom out first so you can zoom in later.\n\nIdeally, its better you do it on the start of the week, but that's fine.\n\nHaving it written down and checking things off boosts you.\n\nSee you next Tuesday ðŸ‘‹\n\n_Thanks for reading. Forward this to your friends if you think theyâ€™ll enjoy too._\n",
