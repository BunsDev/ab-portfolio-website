That's how we can build quality software.\n\nAt least, file a card/issue in your project tracker so that doesn't stay in the app for too long.\n\nEarlier, I only concentrated on doing the task at hand. I wouldn't consider solving an issue if\n\n- it doesn't affect the card I'm working on\n- it's hard to be discovered by boss/QA\n- it leads to an unfinished sprint\n\nThis is how things used to work at my first job. I hate to say it - work culture in India is bad. At least it was bad 3 years ago. It requires effort to unlearn what one does in the beginning of the career.\n\nDon't be that person. If you are a lead or get chance to mentor juniors, don't let them do it as well.\n\nThere is some vibe associated with the applications we build. **When we leave out bugs like that, we know something is not perfect.** And that affects that vibe which makes it hard to release or ship with confidence.\n\nHave you ever felt that vibe? Would love to know your thoughts.\n\nSee you next Tuesday 👋\n\n_Thanks for reading. Forward this to your friends if you think they’ll enjoy too._\n",
