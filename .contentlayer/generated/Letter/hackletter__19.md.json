And trying to build in the public by tweeting when I work.\n\nFew days back, I had a conversation with [Reddy](https://reddy2go.com/) where we talked about why I'm building [Stackblocks](https://stackblocks.app/) on the side, the progress and the future of this product.\n\nHere is the link to listen to it - [https://racket.com/reddy2go/rG58n](https://racket.com/reddy2go/rG58n)\n\nOr I have put up the complete transcript of our conversation on my website. You can [check that out](https://aravindballa.com/writings/conversation-on-why-stackblocks/) as well.\n\nI'm loving building parts of it and progressing on it daily. More stories and learning to come.\n\n---\n\n### No Hackletter next week â›°\n\nI will be on a vacation next week. I could write something early and schedule it so that it reaches you on time, but ...\n\nYou can say I'm already in vacation mode. I'm going on a trek in the Himalayas. It's going to be great. Expect the next letter to be about this.\n\nSee you the next Tuesday. ðŸ‘‹\n\n_Thanks for reading. Forward this to your friends if you think theyâ€™ll enjoy too._\n",
