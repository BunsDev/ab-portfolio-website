Because that is what I'm comfortable with and I like to write code. But with experience, I understood that without proper planning it will take multiple iterations to get to the final outcome.\n\nAnd when **we want to iterate in code, that becomes costly**. Not actual money, but time.\n\nThis is where planning helps. If it's frontend, then a few designs and flows about how the app should look and work. And if it's backend, database and API design.\n\nThis actually **makes writing code easier**. Iterating while designing is a lot easier compared to changing code. You just have to move blocks and text around when you are designing.\n\n### But to what extent?\n\nShould you have every granular detail planned out? I don't think so. It differs from person to person.\n\nI like making some rough sketches for the planned UI. Basically, taking all the decisions while designing so that I can sit and code what's planned without thinking about it much.\n\nHow does it work for you? I'm curious to know.\n\n_Thanks for reading.
