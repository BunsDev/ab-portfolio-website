You have earphones plugged in and you are listening to great ideas from all over the world. _That's how you define podcasts, right?_ You are into it for 9 minutes and one idea in particular gives you that \"aha\" moment. You somehow connect it your previous idea, and you are experiencing this jolt of joy.\n\nYou stop, pull out your phone, pause this podcast, and you want to note it down. \"Opening Roam would take me minutes\", you tell yourself. So you open something quick like Drafts app, note a few point down and the timestamps of that podcast and resume that run.\n\nAfter you come home, you process these quick notes, get it into your PKM system and do nothing about it. _Wait, do nothing about it?_\n\nThis is exactly my story.\n\nI did nothing about it. But I'm changing that up. I'm curating the best content I listen on a [Mixtape](https://mixtape.balla.dev/).\n\n![](https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/24279/full_1632593327-artwork.jpg)\n\nThe format is super short. I clip the interesting parts, add a voiceover at the beginning, or in between, which might include my take on it, and publish.\n\nI've published 6 episodes till now and it's been fun. I'm glad I figured out a way to do everything, from clipping the audio to publishing, on my mobile.\n\nYou can listen to on any podcast player or on the web - [https://mixtape.balla.dev/](https://mixtape.balla.dev/).\n\nI'm happy to share more about the process if you're interested. Just hit reply.\n\nSee you next Tuesday ðŸ‘‹\n\n_Thanks for reading. Forward this to your friends if you think theyâ€™ll enjoy too._\n",
