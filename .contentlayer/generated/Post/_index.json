      "raw": "\nGit is amazing and you will learn only by using it. Try to learn the commands, you will forget if you don't use them. The same is the case for GUIs (like Tower or Source Tree). You might not have to learn the commands, but you will forget the process.\n\n**The solution is very simple. Learn what you need. Google what you don't. Try remembering if you are googling the same thing often.** 😁\n\nAfter using Git for more than 2 years and teaching it to people, there are few tip that I would like to share.\n\n(I use command-line and not a GUI. I feel more comfortable like this.)\n\n# Aliases\n\nGit allows you to have aliases for commands, which we are long or are frequently-used. There will a `~/.gitconfig` file where you can specify them. (If you don't find the file, I think you can create it at HOME path).\n\nThese are the aliases I have.\n\n```bash\n[alias]\n    pl = pull --rebase\n    cm = commit -m\n```\n\nThe most frequently used, as you can guess is `git cm`.\n\n# Rebase\n\nThat leads us to the other alias that I have, `pull —rebase`. This is useful mostly when you work on open-source, or with a lot of branches in your projects. So you make a branch, add a new feature, or fix a bug and make a pull request. By the time you do this, you discover that the `master` was updated and has bunch of commits that are not in your branch.\n\nIn this scenario, —rebase allows you to replay your work on top of master, as if you have created the branch now. Dealing with merge conflicts is also easier this way. If there are any, you can fix them, and `git merge —continue` to continue the rebase of `—abort` to stop it. I use VS Code to fix the conflicts. Its pretty easy.\n\n# Multiple SSH keys\n\nWhat do you do when you have separate accounts for work and personal stuff? Ideally, you should not. The work ones will be private anyways. So maintain only one Github account. But imagine you have two.\n\nI was like this for an year. And switching the accounts is time consuming and a pain if you do it frequently. SSH keys to the rescue! ✌🏻\n\nYou can generate multiple SSH keys with different mail ids(`id_rsa` and `id_rsa_work`) and register them with the Github accounts. When you are accessing the Github, you can give custom URLs for the remotes. For example,\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com-me:aravindballa/preact-ssr.git\ngit clone git@github.com-work:sencha/extjs-reactor.git\n```\n\n(P.S. Yes, I worked for Sencha for short period of time, on the [open-source tooling](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.6.0/guides/getting_started/open_tooling.html) that they released in ExtJS 6.6. I no longer work for them.)\n\nNotice `github.com-me` and `github.com-work`. These are Hostnames that we provide in the ssh config.\n\n```bash\n# ~/.ssh/config\n\nHost github.com-me\n  HostName github.com\n  User git\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nHost github.com-work\n  HostName github.com\n  User git\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work\n```\n\nOne thing, that you have to keep in mind, is the **Author**.\n\nFor the work repos, you will need to manually set the [user.email](http://user.email) to the work email.\n\n```bash\ngit config user.email \"aravind@awesome-company.com\"\n```\n\nOr else, your commits at work will be by your personal account.\n\nPeace out.\n",

So if you're curious you can go [check that episode](https://racket.com/reddy2go/re22y) out.\n\nAravind: So yeah, what I am building right now is called [Stackblocks](https://stackblocks.app), which it's a, it's a tool that allows people who write Substack newsletters embed the archive, in their websites.\n\nAravind: I have seen a lot of people, just have a subscribe box wherein they ask for an email and then just there is a button but there is no way to know what that person has sent before or has written before.\n\nAravind: So this tool will allow the visitor to see the archive like last posts or last five posts or even the top performing substack posts on the website.\n\nAravind: Even before they give you the email ID email address, so that's what I am trying to solve.\n\nReddy: That's really cool.\n\nReddy: So, in a way, because I personally hate putting myself stack, embed form anywhere because it just doesn't fit into the design and I will probably change the design of my website five times in the last five months.\n\nReddy: But not one says, it's kind of like harmoniously fitted in to the overall design aesthetic of the website.\n\nReddy: So I usually, I am just like, you know, just at the most Dropping a link and I say ho follow this link and go there and subscribe. Like I hate embedding that form because it just doesn't look good.\n\nReddy: This is really cool.\n\nReddy: Because if you have done this, this can love me to not just present that singular form, which says, hey, this is op stack, and we can connect.\n\nReddy: But also, like you said, it drops draws people in with some sort of Snippets, not only of the latest issue but even the best issues.\n\nReddy: So how do you see this? You know, like do you see this as something that Can be enabled on anyone's website regardless of the platform?\n\nAravind: Yes. Right now it supports normal HTML code. I mean if someone has used Jekyll or writes in markdown and built website using Gatsby NextJS all this modern tools, then HTML should suffice and then I have a tab for Webflow how to do it on Webflow, how to embed it in Notion because I've seen a lot of tools\nthese days are built on top of Notion, and we have a lot of site generators which use Notion as the CMS.\n\nAravind: So it supports Notion, which means it supports a whole lot of stuff out there.\n\nReddy: This is so good.\n\nReddy: Like you're tempting me to actually go back to using sub stack as a medium because I am always looking for the next new thing.\n\nReddy: You know, old and boring sub stack, at least to me.\n\nAravind: So as you talked about the styling thing, so what I am trying to do now, like right now is to allow people to customize the background color and the font color of the embedded.\n\nAravind: So that it looks like it's in your site and not just a piece of paper that is stuck out in your site.\n\nAravind: I want it to blend in into the users web sites. That's what I am working on right now.\n\nAravind: The next would be to add support for custom fonts if that's possible so that it has the same aesthetic.\n\nReddy: Wow, looks like you're offering more customization than sub stack itself. Yeah, but this is cool because I think, you know, one of the things that's missing because I have always been looking around on this.\n\nReddy: You know what, I call like a Holy Grail? This quest for you know, finding us a unified space where I can have some sort of website or web presence and also a Blog specially to garden and a new salon.\n\nReddy: The closest had come to Was Ghost which offers me to write in the same space and essentially send out the same things that I write on the website to someone's inbox.\n\nReddy: And I think this is taking a step further in that direction because people coming to my website, if they see the page where all my substitute posts are, they can get a feel of my writing, which is on sub stack, without leaving my home page. And I think that's very valuable to keep people because it's easy to lose an audience.\n\nReddy: You know, you have one Platform. And then there's another platform you use for sending things out. So it's difficult for people to know exactly where you decide.\n\nAravind: Yeah, and guess what, not just substack I am planning to like extend the features for other services, like Revuew or Tinymail or all these modern, things buttondown email and I figured out how to do that for a few providers. So after I build things for sub stack end-to-end, then it should be easy to add in.\n\nReddy: Look for other providers as well was also incredible news and think a lot of people were very happy about this cuz I think especially does the idea of having two separate spaces is so difficult to reconcile with on the internet today because otherwise everything kind of like fits in, right?\n\nReddy: We have this whole concept of apis and everything is connected with Zapier over the integral method Etc. And yet we have to like run around to different URLs just to access the content from a single person that seems so counterproductive to me.\n\nAravind: And that's what I am trying to not solve completely but at least move in a step towards that goal to have everything on your website, which is your digital home.\n\nReddy: Nice.\n\nReddy: So what's what do you see in the future for this particular product? And you already have some sort of another project in the making which you have already started ideating brainstorming about now.\n\nAravind: This project actually I started ideating it in January or February, but it took me this long to know that it's a valid problem and start work on it. I wish I should have talked to people earlier and then figured out that this is a valid problem. And I wish, I wish I started early.\n\nAravind: And right now I don't have anything else in mind, but as I do things and as I progress in my life, I am sure I will find some other problem, which I can provide a small solution to.\n\nReddy: Yeah, and do you, do you work on all of these entirely alone? Or is there some sort of team or you like working with someone on this project?\n\nAravind: It's completely me. It's just me completely.\n\nAravind: It's me who is designing the pages. It's me who is writing the code me who is setting up the emails. It's all just one person team for now, but I would love to get someone to Do things that I know how to do. I mean that just makes the process a little easier for me. But right now I am a single person team.\n\nReddy: Yeah that's cooler. Is this what people call the full stack developer where you do everything yourself?\n\nAravind: Yes, full stackdeveloper is basically a person who knows front-end and back-end and but this involves design and ideating and marketing as well. So, I don't know what this is called.\n\nReddy: Okay. Well, I wish you all the best.\n\nReddy: Thank you for hopping on and wish you all the best in the next project for the coming up with, and we would love to share this link. So just tell us how, you know, there's no scan find that URL fine, how to sign up for this etcetera.\n\nAravind: The website is called stack blocks and the URL is stack blocks and Dot app. That's where you can go to sign up and hop into the Early Access list.\n\nReddy: Sweet.

    "description": "With the power of React Context, create re-usable hooks to give your components the ability to listen to websocket events.",
    "banner": "banner.jpeg",
    "bannercaption": "Photo by Melanie Pongratz on Unsplash",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nCreating reusable components is the main plus point when we are working with React. And hooks let us sprinkle powers to those components. Adding some state to the component, for example.\n\nIn this article, we will look at how we can create a custom hook, which powers the component to subscribe and unsubscribe to a websocket so that it can listen to all the events in a channel.\n\n> We will be using [socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/v4/) library. And we don't cover the steps involved to build a server which accepts socket connections.\n\nThe actual process of building a socket client is very simple. We have to create a socket and initialize it, and then add listeners to the channels which respond to events.\n\n```js\nconst socket = io('https://server-domain.com');\n\n// assuming details is the channel we want to listen to\nsocket.on('details', (...args) => {\n  // a callback function\n});\n```\n\nWhen it comes to doing this in React, we might have some decisions to make:\n\n- Do we store the socket instance in state?\n- Or a ref because we wont have to update it.\n- What if I have multiple components that want to use the socket? Maybe I store near the root and pass the socket via props to the components that need it.\n- A lot of passing props. Should I use context now?\n\nThat was exactly my thought process and this is solution I ended up with - we store the socket instance in the context and let the components subscribe using hooks.\n\n> The pattern we use here is inspired by Kent's [How to use Context effectively](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively) post. You might want to have a look for extra clarity.\n\n## Creating the context\n\nLets kick things off by creating the context and exporting the Provider and the hooks so that the components can use them.\n\n```jsx\n// SocketProvider.jsx\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport socketIOClient from 'socket.io-client';\n\nexport const SocketContext = React.createContext({ socket: null });\n```\n\nThat's our Context and we initialize the socket in the context with `null`.\n\nNow let's create the Provider, the component which is responsible for initializing the socket and putting it in the context so that the other components can use.\n\n```jsx\n// SocketProvider.jsx\n\nimport socketIOClient from 'socket.io-client';\n\nconst SocketProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {\n  // we use a ref to store the socket as it won't be updated frequently\n  const socket = useRef(socketIOClient('https://server-domain.com'));\n\n  // When the Provider mounts, initialize it 👆\n  // and register a few listeners 👇\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    socket.current.on('connect', () => {\n      console.log('SocketIO: Connected and authenticated');\n    });\n\n    socket.current.on('error', (msg: string) => {\n      console.error('SocketIO: Error', msg);\n    });\n\n    // Remove all the listeners and\n    // close the socket when it unmounts\n    return () => {\n      if (socket && socket.current) {\n        socket.current.removeAllListeners();\n        socket.current.close();\n      }\n    };\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <SocketContext.Provider value={{ socket: socket.current }}>{children}</SocketContext.Provider>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default SocketProvider;\n```\n\nWe haven't added all the listeners yet. We need to let **components listen to the websocket updates**. So lets create a **custom hook**.\n\n```jsx\n\n// SocketProvider.jsx\n\nexport const useSocketSubscribe = (eventName, eventHandler) => {\n\t// Get the socket instance\n\tconst { socket } = useContext(SocketContext);\n\n\t// when the component, *which uses this hook* mounts,\n\t// add a listener.\n\tuseEffect(() => {\n\t\tconsole.log('SocketIO: adding listener', eventName);\n\t\tsocket.on(eventName, eventHandler);\n\n\t\t// Remove when it unmounts\n\t\treturn () \\=> {\n\t\t\tconsole.log('SocketIO: removing listener', eventName);\n\t\t\tsocket?.off(eventName, eventHandler);\n\t\t};\n\n\t// Sometimes the handler function gets redefined\n\t// when the component using this hook updates (or rerenders)\n\t// So adding a dependency makes sure the handler is\n\t// up to date!\n\t}, [eventHandler]);\n\n};\n```\n\n`useSocketSubscribe()` is our hook. And now, components can just import this hook and use it to add listeners to the global socket.\n\n```jsx\n// ExampleComponent.jsx\n\nimport React from 'react';\n\nimport { useSocketSubscribe } from './SocketProvder';\n\nexport default function ExampleComponent() {\n  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');\n\n  const handleSocketUpdate = (message) => {\n    setSomeState(message);\n  };\n\n  useSocketSubscribe('update', handleSocketUpdate);\n\n  return <div>{someState}</div>;\n}\n```\n\nThere is one last step.

Express is used for server rendered React output.\n\nGenerally in SSR, we have the routing logic in the React application, using `react-router` or some similar kind of library. The server (Express in our case) returns the complete React application for all routes and does not worry about routing.\n\n```javascript\napp.get('*', (req, res, next) => {\n  // ...\n  // res.send(renderToString(<App />)\n});\n```\n\nLet's build a special route, say `/getRenderedComponent`, to give the rendered HTML as a response, as a middleware.\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nexports.renderedCompMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {\n  const items = ['Milk', 'Coffee'];\n  const html = `\n<h2>Server rendered component</h2>\n<ul>\n  ${items.map((item) => `<li>${item}</li>`)}\n</ul>\n`;\n\n  if (req.path.match(/\\/getcomp/)) {\n    res.send({ html });\n    return;\n  }\n  next();\n};\n\n// server.js\napp.get('*', renderedCompMiddleware, (req, res, next) => {\n  // ...\n  // res.send(renderToString(<App />)\n});\n```\n\nWe included it as a middleware, so the request will pass through it. (This might not be the correct way of doing this. We should have a separate route for this).\n\nAt the middleware, we render the HTML. We can even use `react-dom/renderToString` and render a React component to send as a response.\n\nThis response can be consumed in a React component easily. Something which can fetch and render HTML inside it will do the job. Like our `SSRComp`.\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { fetchComp } from './api';\n\nfunction createMarkup(text) {\n  return { __html: text };\n}\n\nclass SSRComp extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      html: '<p>loading<p>',\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetchComp().then((html) => this.setState({ html }));\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const { html } = this.state;\n\n    return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup(html)} />;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default SSRComp;\n```\n\n```javascript\nexport function fetchComp() {\n  return fetch('/getcomp')\n    .then((data) => data.json())\n    .then((comp) => comp.html)\n    .catch((error) => {\n      console.warn(error);\n      return null;\n    });\n}\n```\n\nI don't have an exact idea of where this can be put to a real production environment but was a successful fun experiment.\n\nThanks for reading through.

Mic's were not proper. My audio was bad. _But this is the episode with highest listens!_\n\n# But we could figure things out\n\nWe did not know anything about publishing audio. Luckily, Brittik knew a thing about editing, so at least that was in place.\n\nAfter we recorded the first episode, we had 4 days to figure out things like publishing and creating a landing page, and this deadline helped us put in the work and launch. **We wouldn't have launched if we had to get everything ready before we recorded.** Yes, the first episode wasn't perfect, the audio wasn't clear but guess what, we launched. The website had a single page with a form to collect mail id of interested people.\n\n[Anchor](http://anchor.fm) app made it easy for us to upload audio and publish it across platforms, which was great. It handles all the distribution now and gives us good analytics on how the audience is. We didn't know about Anchor earlier.\n\nI used Gatsby to build our website, which was a single page, and it is hosted on [Netlify](http://netlify.com). It has a form, handled by Netlify Forms to collect mail id's of people interested and we promised to send a mail the podcast launches. We used [Buttondown](http://buttondown.email) for it where we manually imported subscribers from the Netlify form responses to Buttondown.\n\n# After launch\n\nWe published, sent out mails and tweeted about it. People listened to it and a few gave us feedback. Personally, I learnt a lot in this process. We improved episode by episode.\n\nI now use Blue ice mic, which I borrowed from my friend, and its better than having nothing. The quality improved a lot. I record in Garageband (or Audacity sometimes). Brittik made a good intro music and we include it from the 3rd episode onwards. It's a great start to the episodes now. We record in the mornings these days because it's mostly silent and audio is better.\n\nIt's fun to talk about things we love and be able to share it to people. We are looking forward to publish more this year.\n\nI'm really happy to share these stats\n\n![podcast stats](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/0k56jj0cq2lgct3dn24v.png)\n\n# What are you waiting for?\n\nYes you.\n\n~~Go listen to out podcaaasst!

      "raw": "\nWhen you work on huge project with complex code it becomes difficult to keep track of what you are doing and what's been done.\n\nWe generally start work with a goal in mind. We want to add a feature, for example. Or fix this particular bug.\n\nSometimes we know how to do that. We know what steps to achieve and what changes are to be made. Sometimes we don't. We have to figure that out along the way.\n\nIt's like navigating a map. Sometimes you know the roads to take, sometimes you don't. You know the destination though.\n\n![you know vs you don't](maps.jpg)\n\nAfter all, we can't travel all day. We need to rest too.\n\nNow coming back to coding – When we want to take a break or stop work for the day, we are worried all the progress we made might be lost. Because all our thought process will be lost when you stop working on it. When we start work again the next day, we will have to spend some time recollecting what was done and where we were yesterday.\n\nEarlier I used to prefer not taking a break and finish the task at hand so that I don't have to spend more time recollecting the next day.\n\nBut that's a bad habit. Taking breaks is necessary. Recharging is important. ⚡️\n\n## Note taking to the rescue 📝\n\nWhat I started to do is I write some notes in code comments to help future me understand where I left and what are all the things I should take care when I start back.\n\nAdding something like `// you were here 👈` goes a long way.\n\nWhen I know what the next steps are and in which order I need to do tham, I also add numbered TODOs.\n\n```\nsome sample code\n\n// TODO 2. fix this\n\nsome other logic\n\n// TODO 1. add a parameter to the function\n\n```\n\nIt's like marking your location on a map. 📍\n\n![you are here](maps-route.jpg)\n\nWriting also helps you keep track of what's been done and what still has to be. At the start of the file or at a relevant place, write pseudo code or plan the steps you need to achieve. More like documenting your journey.\n\nDon't use your brain to remember the steps. Use it to process your thoughts on how to implement that step.\n\n```\n/**\n * Get the data from API\n * - [x] get all posts data for the index page\n * - [x] now loop on it and make div for each post\n * - [] get single post for the post page\n * ...\n * (you get the point)\n */\n```\n\nThis helps us get better context on what's going on with the project. If you are in a team, it will help others understand where you are, what's done and what's not.\n\nThat's how writing and taking notes while coding helps us. Thanks for reading!\n",

We can use that to make REST calls, get HTML content of a webpage(if we are using node for scraping) and many more things.\n\n> This article is valid for any function that returns a promise.\n\nAn example of such call goes like this\n\n```js\nfetch('/url')\n  .then((res) => res.json())\n  .then((data) => console.log(data));\n```\n\n# The Async way\n\nWe could do the same thing, using async and await.\n\n```js\nconst result = await fetch('/url');\nconst data = await result.json();\n\nconsole.log(data);\n\n// Or, a one-liner\n// const data = await (await fetch('/url')).json(); 😉\n```\n\n# I have so many things to fetch!\n\nOkay fine. We can do that over a classic for loop. The synchronous nature will be preserved. I mean, we can fetch one after the other, synchronously.\n\n```js\nconst urls = [...];\nfor(const url of urls) {\n    const result = await fetch(url);\n    const data = await result.json();\n\n    console.log(data);\n}\n```\n\nBut what if, the order does not matter? We can fetch them all at once. Yes, all at once, using the Promise API. After all, `fetch` returns a promise and that's why we `await` for it to be resolved.\n\nPromise API has this method `Promise.all()` , which can be awaited on for all the promises that it accepts as an argument to be resolved.\n\n```js\nconst urls = [...];\nconst promises = urls.map(url => fetch(url));\n\nawait Promise.all(promises);\n\nfor (const promise of promises) {\n    const data = await promise.json();\n    console.log(data);\n}\n```\n\nThis will save us a lot of time. Imagine we want to parse many webpages, around 100, and each webpage takes 2 seconds to be fetched and scraped for information we need. If we fetch it one after the other, it will take us around 200 seconds, which is over 3 minutes. But if we fetch all at once, it will take under a minute.\n\n# Like, really SO MANY!\n\nWhat is we have over 10000 urls to fetch. If we do the same thing as above, we will most probably not make it. We will have to face some weird socket hangup error. What can we do about it?\n\nThere is a node package called `Bluebird` which has its own Promise API and it functions the same. It has this method called `map`, which takes an extra options argument where we can set concurrency.\n\n`Promise.map(urls => fetch(url), { concurrency: 100 });`\n\nThis will, as we can infer from the line, concurrently fetch 100 requests at a time. This will save a significant load on CPU.\n\n```js\nconst Promise = require('bluebird').Promise;\nconst urls = [...];\nconst promises = await Promise.map(\n    urls => fetch(url),\n    { concurrency: 100 }\n);\n\nfor (const promise of promises) {\n    const data = await promise.json();\n    console.log(data);\n}\n```\n\nThanks for making it till the end.\n\nKeep on Hacking! ✌\n",

There are 2 parts to it.\n\n- One - creating the pages after fetching from the rest API using `createPage()`\n- Two - creating the node in the GraphQL layer to be able to query in other pages (for example in `index.js` where you list all the pages)\n\nAfter adding that piece of code to `gatsby-node.js` and running `gatsby develop` you will have pages created at the `path` you’ve given to `createPage()`.\n\nTo list them in any other page, we can use a query that looks like this\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  allPost(sort: { order: DESC, fields: date }) {\n    nodes {\n      slug\n      title\n      date\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can experiment with the query in GraphiQL dashboard that runs when you `gatsby develop`.\n\nHope this helps.\n",

      "raw": "\nGatsby, which is a static site generator, is famous for blogs and documentation websites. But there is no wrong in build full blown React apps with it.\n\nIn the case of a blog, Gatsby builds a page for every article at the build time and generates a directory which can be hosted directly. But when it comes to Single Page App (SPA), we have only one `index.html` at the root, and the components are loaded depending on the route that the user is in.\n\nWe can get the benefits of code spitting with some React lazy suspense features with some minimal extra work too.\n\n```jsx\nconst Contact = React.lazy(() => import('../components/Contact'));\nconst LazyContact = (props) => (\n  <React.Suspense fallback={'<p>Loading...</p>'}>\n    <Contact {...props} />\n  </React.Suspense>\n);\n```\n\nThe `Contact` component is loaded only when it will be rendered, which is when we hit a particular route. We will have a look at the routes in a moment.\n\n## But wait\n\nBefore that, we need a `gatsby-node.js` file to let Gatsby know that we want all the route to end up in `index.html`\n\nAfter cloning Gatsby's Default starter, let's add this file.\n\n```js\n// gatsby-node.js\n\nexports.onCreatePage = ({ page, actions }) => {\n  const { createPage } = actions;\n  if (page.path === `/`) {\n    page.matchPath = `/*`;\n    createPage(page);\n  }\n};\n```\n\nNow we are ready.\n\n## Components for each Routes\n\nLet's plan to have two routes, `/contact` and `/about` . In `src/components` we will create basic components like this.\n\n```jsx\n// src/components/Contact.js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconsole.log('contact component');\n\nexport default function () {\n  return <div>Contact Us as you like.</div>;\n}\n\n// src/components/About.js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconsole.log('about component');\n\nexport default function () {\n  return <div>We are a great bunch of people</div>;\n}\n```\n\nI've added the console logs to check when this file is loaded. We don't want it to load at the homepage. Rather only when the route is visited.\n\n## Main App\n\nIn the main page, which is `src/pages/index.js` we make use for `@reach/router` which Gatsby itself, uses for routing.\n\n```jsx\n// src/pages/index.js\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Router, Link } from '@reach/router';\n\nconst Contact = React.lazy(() => import('../components/Contact'));\nconst About = React.lazy(() => import('../components/About'));\n\nconst LazyComponent = ({ Component, ...props }) => (\n  <React.Suspense fallback={'<p>Loading...</p>'}>\n    <Component {...props} />\n  </React.Suspense>\n);\n\nconst Home = () => <h2>Hello and Welcome</h2>;\n\nconst IndexPage = () => (\n  <div>\n    <h1>Hi people</h1>\n    <Link to=\"/\">Home</Link>\n    <br />\n    <Link to=\"/contact/\">Contact</Link>\n    <br />\n    <Link to=\"/about-us\">About Us</Link>\n    <br />\n\n    <input />\n\n    <Router>\n      <Home path=\"/\" />\n      <LazyComponent Component={Contact} path=\"contact\" />\n      <LazyComponent Component={About} path=\"about-us\" />\n    </Router>\n  </div>\n);\n```\n\n`LazyComponent` renders the `Component` we pass to it as a prop under `React.Suspense` with a fallback.\n\nIf you build this project and serve, you can open the Networks tab in the browser console and see that a new JS file is loaded when you hit the `/contact` route for the first time.\n\nThat's it, this is all we need to make an SPA using Gatsby.\n\nHere is a working codesandbox link - [https://codesandbox.io/s/gatsby-starter-default-yf72w](https://codesandbox.io/s/gatsby-starter-default-yf72w)\n",

A Gatsby site can be built from an API or just with some data from a JSON file.\n\n> You don't need GraphQL.\n\nIf you don't know what [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is, it is a static site generator built in React. You can use React to build the components of the website and give them to Gatsby, which will then generate a blazing fast website for you.\n\nIf you are interested in building it from an API, [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/using-gatsby-without-graphql/) is a well demonstrated example.\n\nIf most of you site is static and only certain part of it changes, why would you need GraphQL to fetch things.\n\nLet us build a site from just a JSON file which contains some data.\n\n# Let's Start\n\nStep One is to clone the `hello-world-starter` and make sure everything works.\n\n```bash\nnpx gatsby new hello-world https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world\ncd hello-world\nyarn develop\n```\n\nNow, `http://localhost:8000` should say, \"hello world!\".\n\n# Adding the data\n\nAdd a JSON file at `content/data.json` which has information on the pages. The path is just a personal preference ;)\n\n```javascript\n// content/data.json\n{\n  \"pages\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"About\",\n      \"slug\": \"about\",\n      \"paragraphs\": [\n        {\n          \"heading\": \"Work\",\n          \"content\": \"Works as a Javascript Enginneer. Has experience with Gatsby, React, Javascript, Node, Mongo and a little Python as well\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Talks\",\n      \"slug\": \"talks\",\n      \"paragraphs\": [\n        {\n          \"heading\": \"Building A Progressive Web App\",\n          \"content\": \"PWA (Progre...\"\n        },\n        ...\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n# Template to render the Page\n\nNext, we create a template which will get the data from the JSON and render it to the webpage.\n\n```javascript\n// src/templates/page.js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst PageTemplate = (props) => {\n  const { title = null, paragraphs = null } = props.pageContext;\n\n  return (\n    <React.Fragment>\n      {title && <h1>{title}</h1>}\n      {paragraphs &&\n        paragraphs.map((para) => (\n          <div>\n            <h2>{para.heading}</h2>\n            <p>{para.content}</p>\n          </div>\n        ))}\n    </React.Fragment>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default PageTemplate;\n```\n\nA very naive and basic React component which gets `title` and `paragraphs` in the `pageContext` and it renders them. We will get to how the data is passed to `pageContext` in a while.\n\n# Create the Pages now!\n\nHow do we tell Gatsby what pages it should create? By creating `gatsby-node.js`!\n\n```javascript\n// gatsby-node.js\nconst path = require(`path`);\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nexports.createPages = ({ actions }) => {\n  const { createPage } = actions;\n\n  const pageData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./content/data.json', { encoding: 'utf-8' }));\n  const blogPostTemplate = path.resolve(`src/templates/page.js`);\n\n  pageData.pages.forEach((page) => {\n    createPage({\n      path: page.slug,\n      component: blogPostTemplate,\n      context: {\n        ...page,\n      },\n    });\n  });\n};\n```\n\nHere, we use `createPages()` API, where we loop through all the pages from the JSON data, and call `createPage()` action to create the actual page. Here we pass the template(which is component) and the URL(path) where the page has to be generated. The actual data is passed as `context`. This is the context that we use in our Page template to populate the data.\n\n# Run\n\nBoom! It actually works of you have used `yarn develop`. It hot reloads every change you make. Now you can navigate to `http://localhost:8000/talks` and `/about` pages and see how they look (and feel good about yourself).\n\nYou realise the potential of Gatsby, right? Possibilities are limitless. In this case, you just have to add styles and you have a portfolio site.\n\nThanks for reading through.\n\nKeep on hacking!\n",

Sometimes I work from home when I have to do my daily chores, and sometimes from nearby coffee shops.\n\nI really enjoy that I don't go to **an office** to work every day. Gone are those days when I had to sit at the same place to work (under the nose of my manager) and feel guilty to take a break or spend some time in the cafeteria.\n\nThe days earlier were daunting(in a way) and I did not have time for anything other than work. I used to work my ass off even in the weekends, sometimes. I could not function like this more than 6 months. These were the first 6 months of my day job, and I clearly knew I was getting exhausted. This was not the way to work, for me especially. It even took a toll on my productivity. Zero progress on side-projects or the things I wanted to learn or the books I wanted to read. The to-do lists just kept increasing.\n\n> You cannot function for long without re-fueling yourselves.\n\nI decided to change this. I took up a remote position at an awesome company. They are the best people I've ever worked with. A lot of things, including my lifestyle, have changed lately. I really enjoy the work I do, along with the life I am living.\n\n# Things that I take benefit of\n\n## Flexibility - time 🕰\n\nI don't have to work at strict timings anymore. If I have some other work in the afternoon, I can shift my work timing to the night. If I don't like to work in the day, because of the noise out there, I can become a batman and work at nights.\n\nOur team is remote. The main pro, and also a con, of a completely remote team is **availability**. But, when well managed, this is not such a problem. When you know, who will be available at what time and when to expect replies, you can adapt to the routine. I use [There app](https://there.pm) to keep track of the different time zones my colleagues are in.\n\n## Flexibility - location 🏕\n\nNo office to go to. I go to a co working space in the city centre and work from there. I could not function alone from home for more than a month. I go to that space to have some people around. I met some amazing people there. Co-working spaces have have diverse people. From startup founders to designers to architects I've met them all. Its good to talk to them about the work they do and listen to the problems they face.\n\n![an image of co working space](workspace.jpeg)\n\nI visit my family often. I go home during some weekends and extend my stay there for few days.\n\nI work from coffee shops if I need some change and I am getting to like it. I am planning to do it more often. I get more work done in a coffee shop. Maybe the aroma makes me more productive. 😉\n\n(Also, I can wear anything I want.)\n\nTravelling to other cities has been on my checklist from long ago and I will check that off soon. I plan to stay in another city for a month.\n\n## Free time\n\nI can now attend conferences and speak at meetups. I learned a lot by attending conferences and events. I should start writing and publishing about those experiences too.\n\n![aravind balla talk seminar about react](talk.jpg)\n\nAlso, I love sharing the things I've learnt, so I speak at few meetups.\n\n> Those who know, do. Those who understand, teach.\n\nNot only this, I now have time for hobbies. I have been learning [German](https://www.duolingo.com/aravindballa) and I am loving it. _Vershest du Duestch?_\n\nI read books in the evening sometimes. This year, I want to do it more. One book a month is the goal. This is the progress till now - [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35045477-aravind-balla).\n\nI find myself pull out a notebook and practicing hand lettering sometimes. A complete beginner though.\n\n![beginner hand lettering picture](art.jpeg)\n\nAll these things are helping me unwind after work and being in track. Productivity and the quality of work I do has improved a lot. I am learning great things at my job and it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to be.\n\n# So...\n\nI encourage you to introspect and see where is your life taking you to and where do you want to be. Change things that you are not happy with and I hope this post helps you (a little bit) in doing so.\n",

For example, in our case, considering our podcast's website has a page for each episode, we need to redeploy after we release a new podcast episode. This adds friction to the content creation process.\n\nModern hosting providers have become powerful now. Netlify or Vercel give you a webhook, which can be pinged to trigger a new build.

We generally have all the pages built in advance if we use SSG. But in this case, we can specify `fallback: true` for lazy building. After the site has been deployed, it does it on the fly. _Isn't that cool!_\n\nThis actually adds superpowers to SSG. I talked about updating our podcast episode after every new release, right? Well, this would enable us to just fetch the page after a release.\n\n---\n\n## Is this perfect?\n\nWell, not really. We do sacrifice the first visit. First visit still sees the old data and then it refetches.\n\n**Should you use it over SSG?**\n\nDefinetly no. In some case, it is better to see old data instead of stale data first and new data later. Or always new data where one would choose SSR.\n\nFor data that isn't updated very frequently, but not always the same is a good fit. For example a page which fetches highlights of book.

    "tags": "web-development,javascript,reactjs,react",
    "banner": "banner.jpeg",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nYou are probably not starting a new project with React in the frontend. You just want to build some components, make use of the apis that your frontend already consumes and use them in your existing application.\n\nAwesome! You can always do that. Let me outline the workflow here.\n\nTake the built output js file and include it your HTML(application). You would need to add React and ReactDOM to the HTML to mount the components on to the page.\n\n```javascript\nclass WelcomeComp extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { name: '' };\n    if (props.name) this.state = { name: props.name };\n  }\n\n  updateName = (name) => this.setState({ name });\n\n  render() {\n    return <p>I am a React Component. Hello {this.state.name}</p>;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe transpiled version of the above code is most probably the output you would be getting from build system. (Webpack isn’t mandatory. You can use gulp or grunt if you development is setup using them.)\n\nNext up is including things in your application. I am including directly into HTML.\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Sandbox</title>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <script src=\"<https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.production.min.js>\"></script>\n    <script src=\"<https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.production.min.js>\"></script>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\"></div>\n    <div id=\"root\"></div>\n\n    <script src=\"build/existing.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"build/WelcomeComp.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n      var rootEl = document.getElementById('root');\n      ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(WelcomeComp, null, null), rootEl);\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis would mount the component to the root div. Remember you cannot use JSX here as the script in HTML has a type `text/javascript`. So we used `React.createElement()` instead of `<WelcomeComp />`.\n\n### The issue\n\nBut how would your Component communicate with the existing application? You could be fetching and sending requests from the component itself. Which would need some React code, that isn’t an issue. But in some cases, you need the component to sync up with existing stores in your application.\n\nMaybe you have an ExtJS store or a RxJS store, maybe a MobX one. How do you sync the component with it? 🤔\n\n### React ref to our rescue\n\nYou can pass a reference to the component and store it as a local variable in the code. All the methods in the React Component can be accessed through those refs. Don’t quite get it? Here is the code.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var rootEl = document.getElementById('root');\n  var componentProps = {\n    name: 'Balla',\n    ref: function (ref) {\n      this.welcomeComp = ref;\n    },\n  };\n  ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(WelcomeComp, componentProps, null), rootEl);\n\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    this.welcomeComp.updateName('Aravind');\n  }, 2000);\n</script>\n```\n\nSyncing is easy now. When ever there is an update, you can just call a method that changes the Component state. See how I did it in a timeout. You can even pass methods that update the store, in the props, and make the Component call it whenever it has to update.\n\nKeep on hacking!\n\n### References\n\n- [https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html)\n- The transpiler used  —  [https://babeljs.io/repl/](https://babeljs.io/repl/)\n",

      "raw": "\nSometimes, a few updates/computations take up a lot of time. They block the UI from updating, which makes it look as if things are slow. I am not talking about asynchronous data fetches which take time.\n\n> TL DR; We will be using web workers as a solution along with Hooks.\n\nConsider this for example\n\n```javascript\n// Codesandbox - https://codesandbox.io/s/admiring-pond-ixp59\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\nconst fib = (i) => (i <= 1 ? i : fib(i - 1) + fib(i - 2));\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');\n  const [length, setLength] = React.useState(0);\n\n  // whenever `value` changes\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    // we calculate the fibonnaci of the length of input * 5\n    const result = fib(value.length * 5);\n    setLength(result);\n  }, [value]);\n\n  const handleChange = async (e) => {\n    const { value } = e.target;\n    setValue(value);\n  };\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>\n      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>\n      <input value={value} onChange={handleChange} />\n      <p>{length}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById('root');\nReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);\n```\n\nWhen we enter the input here, it takes time to update. And it waits for the update to show up until,\ntill the result calculation is not finished. Fibonacci for large numbers is expensive.\nIt even freezes your browser tab if the input is long.\n\nDo we have a solution to this? Can we some how **off-load** this computation from the main thread?\n_(Why is he talking about threads in javascript?)_\n\n## Web Workers\n\nWeb workers act as threads which are handled/processed by our browser. We can start a worker as a thread and communicate with it in a particular way. React is after all Javascript UI library, and we are running it in the browser, so why not?\n\nThis is the worker, which has to be statically served. (Put in `public` folder)\n\n```javascript\n// thread.worker.js\nconst fib = (i) => (i <= 1 ? i : fib(i - 1) + fib(i - 2));\n\nself.addEventListener('message', ({ data }) => {\n  let { type, payload } = data;\n  if (type === 'UPDATE') {\n    payload = payload > 11 ? 11 : payload; // upper limit we set\n    const result = fib(payload * 5);\n    self.postMessage({ type: 'UPDATE_SUCCESS', payload: result });\n  }\n});\n\nself.addEventListener(\n  'exit',\n  () => {\n    process.exit(0);\n  },\n  false\n);\n```\n\nWe communicate with the worker using events. Look at the code here, we are listening 👂 to `message` events. We process the data according to `type` passed and return the result as a message.\n\nIf you can guess right, we will have to listen to these messages from the worker in our component. Our component goes like this.\n\n```javascript\n// App.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\nimport './styles.css';\n\nconst worker = new Worker('/thread.worker.js');\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');\n  const [length, setLength] = React.useState(0);\n\n  // when mount and unmount\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    const listener = ({ data: { type, payload } }) => {\n      console.log(type, payload);\n      if (type === 'UPDATE_SUCCESS') setLength(payload);\n    };\n    worker.addEventListener('message', listener);\n    return () => worker.removeEventListener('message', listener);\n  }, []);\n\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    worker.postMessage({ type: 'UPDATE', payload: value.length });\n  }, [value]);\n\n  const handleChange = async (e) => {\n    const { value } = e.target;\n    setValue(value);\n  };\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>\n      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>\n      <input value={value} onChange={handleChange} />\n      <p>{length}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById('root');\nReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);\n```\n\nIf you are using Webpack, you can load it into your component with `worker-loader!thread.js`. We are directly using `Worker()` to load it from the `public` directory.\n\nHere is the codesandbox demo - [https://codesandbox.io/s/funny-nightingale-5kxo1](https://codesandbox.io/s/funny-nightingale-5kxo1)\n\n> Here is the [Effect Hook documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) for reference.\n\nWe are adding the listeners for the messages in the **first effect**, where the dependencies are `[]`, which means this will [run](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#tip-optimizing-performance-by-skipping-effects) when the component is mounting and unmounting.\n\nAnd in the **second effect**, we send a message to the worker whenever the value changes.\n\nWe can see a huge performance bump with workers when we compare it to the first demo. The load is taken up by the browser now.\n\nThat's how you can use web workers in React. Thanks for reading!\n\nKeep on Hacking! ✌\n",

      "raw": "\nIt takes time to realise Server-side rendering is amazing.😁 It was the same for me. You get a ton of benefits with it. Mainly, **first meaningful paint** of the webpage is quick. It still has to download the `js` to make it interactive. But, users will **not** be staring at white (empty) pages for long.\n\nAs you might know, [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is the 3KB alternative to React. It is a bit faster than React and very less in size. The API is mostly same and easy to adapt if you are coming from React.\n\nLet's see how we can do that using Node on the server. We will be using `preact-router` for the routing at the client side.\n\nThis is the [repo](https://github.com/aravindballa/preact-ssr) that I have created, if you want to follow along.\n\n## `mkdir`\n\nCreate an empty directory and `npm init` it!\n\nNow, we install the necessary things.\n\n```bash\nyarn add preact preact-router preact-render-to-string express\n\nyarn add -D webpack webpack-cli babel-core babel-cli babel-loader\nbabel-preset-env babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx babel-register\n```\n\nThere are a few new packages that are helping us here.\n\n`preact-render-to-string` - This will help us render the App to string so that we can include this in the HTML that we send out to the client.\n\n`babel-register` - helps in transpiling ES6 code at run time on the server.\n\n## Webpack 🔷\n\nLook at the repo to see how the project is structured. `client` folder contains the Preact code and the `webpack` is configured to generate a build from that folder to a file.\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: {\n    app: './client/index.js',\n  },\n  output: {\n    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),\n    filename: '[name].js',\n  },\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.js$/,\n        loader: 'babel-loader',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\n## Server 🚀\n\nThe main file is `index.js` here where it requires babel to be present at runtime and help in transpiling code.\n\n```javascript\nrequire('babel-register')({\n  presets: ['env'],\n  plugins: [['transform-react-jsx', { pragma: 'h' }]],\n});\nrequire('./server');\n```\n\n`{\"pragma\": \"h\"}` is given as an option to the `transform-react-jsx` babel plugin because we are dealing with Preact and `createElement` is `h()` in it.\n\nBabel can do the magic once you tell this to it. ✨\n\nNow we have `server.js` where the rendering logic is present.\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst { h } = require('preact');\nconst renderToString = require('preact-render-to-string');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst chalk = require('chalk');\n\nconst App = require('./client/App');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 8080;\n\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist')));\n\napp.listen(port);\n\napp.get('*', (req, res) => {\n  const html = renderToString(<App />);\n\n  res.send(`\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\">\n  <title>Preact SSR</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div id=\"app\">${html}</div>\n  <script src=\"./app.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n    `);\n});\n\nconsole.log(chalk.blue(`Server started at http://localhost:${port}`));\n```\n\nSee how we are generating `html` and including it in `res.send()`. We include the Webpack output, `app.js`, as a script tag. As we have set `express.static` as the `dist` directory, Express will serve that folder as well.\n\nThat's it.\n\n## 🏃\n\nRun `node index.js` to see the magic. 🎉\n\nTake Care\n",

Doing this is important because our human brains are good at processing but not so good at remembering (or storing) them.\n\n> Human brain is a CPU and not a HDD.\n\nAnd, writing is a great way to find insights and gather all our thoughts together. We store all of them in our second brain.\n\n## What would a second brain contain?\n\nAs I just said, all the thoughts that we type, or scribble. We consume a lot of content. And sometimes that content triggers new ideas, or extends an existing view that we previously had. How good would it be to store all of that?\n\nBrain is a great organ and to be able to fully utilise it, we should be able to store all the things that it has produced so far, and use that the next time. _What does brain produce? Thoughts!_\n\nThere are so many apps which we can use to write things and make it our second brain. Ideally, we would need a good search feature to be able to discover back the thoughts quicker. Organising our second brain is a different huge topic. (If you’re interested, you can checkout a [podcast episode](https://learningcurve.dev/15) we did.)\n\n## How has it helped me?\n\nI’ve been maintaining a second brain (without actually realising it was one) from more than 4 years. Last time I had to give a talk on a topic, it was crazy how I could go through my second brain and come up with an outline for that talk in less than half n hour. I could search for all the things I had thought about that topic very easily. If I had to sit down and try recollect everything, then it would obviously take up a lot of time, and, I’d miss out on a lot of stuff.\n\nThe outline for this article was also made in my second brain, by looking up what I had on second brain. _No, this ain’t inception._\n\n## You should make parts of your second brain public\n\nOur thoughts and ideas and thoughts are more worthy than we generally think. We cannot expect what one thought can do to (in a positive sense) the right person at the right time. When we publish our thoughts in the public, they get consumed by other and it gets a scope to further evolve.\n\nThis is a strong reason I believe where we should show up in the public, share things that matter and inspire each other.\n\nI do it using [`gatsby-theme-andy`](https://balla.dev/g-andy) which is a Gatsby theme I built _(ahem ahem)_, where I write content in markdown and let the theme and Gatsby create a website out of it.\n\nIf this feels like an overkill, sure, you can just **tweet a lot**. You can reference your old tweets, build upon them, crosslink them, make long threads, what ever and create a space out there for your thoughts to exist and for people to find you. I am no expert at this, but I am trying to tweet more, and be a nerdy ambitious internet friend (yes, that is coined by [Visa](https://twitter.com/visakanv)). Again, all these tweets are spawned by the thinking I do while writing.\n\nIf you are interested in this and want to hear more on this topic, my co-host Brittik and I made few episodes on this on our podcast.

You can't take it live, you can't invite friends to use it, you can't charge people.\n\nThe criticality of tasks doesn't match with the effort or fun that task is.\n\nThis is where **proritization** helps.\n\n## The MoSCoW method\n\n![MoSCoW](moscow.jpg)\n\nWith a huge list of things we want to do, we can categorize them in one of these buckets -\n\n- **Must**. The critical pieces that make your product are the ones in this bucket. They make up the MVP.\n\n- **Should**. This bucket has important tasks that aren't critical and can wait for sometime. You would want to implement them but not absolutely necessary. Adding multiple ways to sign in, for example\n\n- **Could**. \"Nice to have\" tasks make up this bucket. These can be safe to leave out when you don't have the time for it. Things like adding animations or a dark mode for the app can be in this.\n\n- **Won't**. Tasks that no longer align with your goals for the product end up in this bucket.\n  After a certain time with your product, you might want to implement everything. But when you are starting out, shipping MVP to you initial customers, prioritization is absolutely essential.\n\n## How can we implement this\n\nMost tools that we use to write down all the tasks in our mind have some system to tag the task. A Notion board can have a property, task in Todoist can have filter and so on. It can be easy used to categorize them into one of the buckets above.\n\nWe can then schedule focus blocks in our calendar where we work on the `must`s first. This ensures we get the most important things first and take us closer to the (imaginary 😅) finish line.\n\nAs and when we finish the `must`s, tasks from `should` can jump up and now be a `must`. Priority will change as the product progresses.\n\nI also suggest we take out some time, at least once every week, to review and clean up the tasks, assign them to proper buckets.\n\nEffectiveness of all productive systems keep reducing when we don't keep reviewing them.\nHope this helps you in your journey as a Indie hacker!\n\n### References\n\nThere is a great article called [The MoSCoW method of prioritization](https://nesslabs.com/moscow-method) by Anne-Laure from Ness Labs, which inspired me to write this.\n",

      "raw": "\nSiri shortcuts are a game changer. It was one of the reasons I bought an iPhone. _(Well, at least I feel good when I think like that)_\n\nIf there is a task that takes opening up a few apps and clicking buttons in it, it can be done with a single click using Shortcuts. It’s crazy.\n\n> This blog post is a work in progress. Message Aravind on Twitter if you want to know or talk more about this.\n\n## Save Tweets for later\n\nLet’s look at a shortcut which **adds a Tweet to my ToDo app**. _Why? You have bookmarks in Twitter, right? — you may ask._ I don’t want to use bookmarks for tweets that I just want to have a look later, and not save them. So, it’s helpful if I just add to my ToDo app which I can check off after having a look at it. And to do this, we would have to copy the tweet’s URL, open the ToDo app, and paste it. But with shortcuts, I can just share the tweet to the shortcut from the share menu, and it gets added.\n\n## Properly turn off WiFi\n\niOS doesn’t turn off the WiFi completely when you pull the menu from top-right, it just `Disables it till tomorrow`. This is frustrating. I would expect it to turn off when I turn it off. I use a Shortcut as a work around here. I can turn off WiFi completely from there.\n\n## What did I tweet?\n\nMany a times, I want to look at my tweets about a topic. I can use Twitter search for it — `from:aravindballa search-string`. But when I want to lookup when I’m drafting a tweet, I have to save tweet as a draft and search it in the app. Instead, I have a Shortcut which prompts me to enter a string, and then opens Safari page with the search results. This lets me easily look at past tweets and copy the URL if I want to link it.\n\n## What’s playing?\n\nI collect songs interesting songs on the go from places like cafes and restaurants. Some play cool music. I look up on Shazam for the song and save it to a playlist in Apple Music. That takes a few clicks. But with Shortcuts, one tap and the song gets added to a playlist.\n\n## Custom icons on iPhone Home screen\n\nThere was a wave of people doing funky things with their home screens when someone found out you can have custom icons for apps using shortcuts. Mainly because you couldn’t do those kind of customizations on iOS earlier . Few made a lot of money selling icon packs. Mine is minimal.\n\n## Notes on the fly\n\nI use Drafts to take quick notes when in a rush. It automatically syncs to other devices. And it opens a fresh new note whenever I open the app. It’s purely for quick notes and first drafts. And when in a rush, we can just dictate a note using shortcuts, without even opening the app. All the shortcuts can be run using Siri. _Hey Siri, dictate note_ and the note gets recorded and saved as text in Drafts. You can use any other note taking app for that matter, if it supports Shortcuts, not just Drafts.\n",

This is just icing over the cake and a process that fits nicely in my routine.\n\nThe setup involves 2 apps, Working Copy & iA Writer, and my iPad. And it costs ₹1799 + ₹2699.\n\n**Working Copy** is a Git client for iOS and iPadOS. I works really well to clone, add new commits and push (requires a pro subscription, hence ₹1799 cost).\n\n**iA Writer** is a beautiful, focused, markdown writing app. Its the one you see in the picture above.\n\n## How it works together\n\nWorking copy clones the repositories to the Files locally. I open the repo in iA Writer and edit / add new content. I go back to Working Copy, select the changes and push. The website is updated. 🎉\n\n## Things I like in this setup\n\n- **Offline first**. I can open and start writing on iPad irrespective of the network connection\n- **Syncs** directly to GitHub, so it gets built and deployed when updated.\n- It looks beautiful, keeps me focused and lets me use my **iPad**. Which is good because, I don’t want to open / sit with my laptop after work.\n\n## Bonus\n\nWhen ever I open iA Writer, [Shortcuts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id915249334?mt=8) (automations) make sure the content I have is up to date by pulling content from the repository. Thanks [Quinn](https://twitter.com/com/status/1364637833965797378?s=21)!\n\nI still manually commit the changes from Working Copy app as I don’t want to push commits (and re deploy the website) every time I close the app.\n\n---\n\nThis is likely to evolve or discarded completely. 😅\nI’ll post the updates here as usual.\n",

      "raw": "\nGithub Actions are really powerful. I like to see them as personal assistants. You tell your assistants to do some work for you. Similarly, you tell Github actions to do some job for you.\n\n<GrayBlock>\n\nI've recorded a video while building this. If you'd like to watch me build, here is the video 👇\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI_B99Yw4kY\n\n</GrayBlock>\n\nThe main usecase for these actions, I feel, is when we use it to publish your library to npm or deploying your app on S3 or Github Pages whenever you push new changes. CI/CD - like the techies call it.\n\nThese actions can be triggered in different scenarios. In the above usecase, it is triggered on `push`. Similarly, you can also do it on a `pull-request` where we run a few checks or welcome new contributors to the project.\n\nAnother way to trigger an action is on a `schedule`, which is what I used to make the action Tweet everyday. 🗓We can give CRON expressions to schedule the triggers for the action.\n\n_Okay, where do we tell all these things to the Action? There's got to be some config, right?_\n\nYeah. We have a `yaml` file for every action and we specify all the configuration for it there. All the yamls for your actions lie in `.github/workflows` path in your GitHub repo.\n\nThis is the action config I wrote\n\n(Trimmed version. Full code [here](https://github.com/aravindballa/learningcurve.dev/blob/master/.github/workflows/tweet.yml))\n\n```yml\nname: Tweet\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 10,16 * * *'\n```\n\nNow we know how to schedule things. Next step?\n\n## Tweet\n\nWe know there should be an API to post tweets. But for that, you need a few API credentials from Twitter. This was a big time taking process for me as the application for a dev account on Twitter had to go through a few reviews from Twitter employees.\n\nOnce you get the credentials, tweeting is as easy as the code below.\n\n[Full Code](https://github.com/aravindballa/learningcurve.dev/blob/master/scripts/getQuote.js)\n\n```js\nconst Twitter = require('twitter');\n\nconst client = new Twitter({\n  consumer_key: process.env.TWITTER_API_KEY,\n  consumer_secret: process.env.TWITTER_API_SECRET,\n  access_token_key: process.env.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY,\n  access_token_secret: process.env.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET,\n});\n\nclient.post('statuses/update', { status: tweet }, function (error, tweet, response) {\n  if (!error) {\n    console.log(tweet);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nI have this in a file `scripts/getQuote.js` and I run using `yarn tweet`. We add a script in `package.json` to be able to do this.\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"tweet\": \"node  scripts/getQuote.js\",\n}\n```\n\n## Last step\n\nWhat's remaining now is that we tell our Action to run `yarn tweet` and that's it.\n\n```yml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Tweet it yo\n        run: |\n          yarn install\n          yarn tweet\n        env:\n          CI: true\n          TWITTER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_API_KEY }}\n          TWITTER_API_SECRET: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_API_SECRET }}\n          TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY }}\n          TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET }}\n```\n\nIf you observe, we pass the Twitter API credentials as environment variables. This can be done in the Repo settings in GitHub. You can add a few secrets and they get passed to the Actions in that repo.\n\n![Screenshot of Github Repo settings](github-repo-settings.png)\n\nThat takes us to the end of the article.
