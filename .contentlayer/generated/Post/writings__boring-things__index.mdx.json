    "raw": "\nYou read that right. In order to become better, do boring things **consistently**.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe boring stuff, things which are not Snapchat-able or Instagram-able, are the ones that make you better.\n\nEating at home is boring. Working out is boring. Reading a book is boring. Journaling is boring.\n\nNote that every activity is not boring to every person. It differs.\n\n## Why is it hard to do these things?\n\nWe are **dopamine junkies**. That's the reason behind scrolling these infinite feeds all day. Apps from the big companies, like Instagram, Twitter etc, have properly taken advantage of this.\n\nThey don't do you any good other than stimulating you.\n\nBut the boring activities don't give you the dopamine. So it's not interesting.\n\n## Why should you still do them?\n\nBecause you want to become a better you. No kidding.\n\nHave you heard about compounding? It's where your results in turn help you get more of them. For example, profits from you financial investments help you earn more profits when reinvested.\n\nMost of the boring activities compound.\n\nIf you workout every day, which is boring, you get healthier and stronger. The stronger you can lift even heavier weights making you more stronger.\nSee?\n\n## But, how can you keep doing them?\n\n**Reward yourself frequently.** After you eat home cooked boring food all week, reward yourself with a cheat meal.\n\nConstantly ask yourself how can I make this interesting? For example - Journaling everyday is boring. You can make it interesting by keeping a list of prompts and choosing to journal about a random prompt.\n\nThat's all for now.\n",
