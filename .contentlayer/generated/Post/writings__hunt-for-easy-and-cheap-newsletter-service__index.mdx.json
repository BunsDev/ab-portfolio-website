You spend some time figuring out things as you don't have endless money to get a task\n  done.\n</Toggle>\n\nMy priorities for the dream newsletter service are these\n\n- Great writing experience or just plain Markdown works\n- API for adding subscribers as I like to have custom forms on my blog (like the one at the bottom of this page)\n- Analytics telling me how many people opened\n- Free of cost or costs little (too much to ask?)\n\nOne thing that gets close to those is [Mailbluster](https://mailbluster.com/), which uses your own SES credentials to send emails, so it's very cheap.\nThe editor is bad though.\nAnd there is no API.\n\nEven if I build a simple markdown to html-email generator (which I did in the past), I have to open Mailbluster and send the emails.\n\n## Enter, Ghost\n\n[Ghost](https://ghost.org) is a great publishing platform.\nThe editor is best in class.\nLike Notion.\n\nNot just that, it can send really nice emails to the subscribers.\n\n**Here is the good part** - If you self host it, you can have unlimited subscribers and send as many email you'd like with Mailgun account.\n\nMailgun is almost free.\nAfter first 1000 free emails, other 1000 cost 1$ in that month.\n\nSo the upsides with Ghost\n\n- Great writing experience\n- Unlimited subscribers\n- Unlimited emails\n- Costs less for the emails and for the hosting\n- Also, I can have multiple different newsletters (for future)\n\n## Where do we host it, though?\n\nRemember I'm not using this a blog or personal portfolio.\nJust for sending newsletters.\n\nIt doesn't have to be fast and no visitors on the site, as I'm using it only for sending newsletters.\nIt is only me using the app and the emails get routed though Mailgun anyways.\nSo a cheap server works.\n\nI'd say you can do it just on your laptop or a home server. Railway is a good choice if you want it to be available everywhere.\n\nOr, a service which lets you host it for free, like [Digital Press](https://www.digitalpress.blog/).\nTheir free plan puts ads on your content, but guess what - I don't publish content, just send emails.\n\nWe now have something that costs almost nothing, with great upsides.\n\nWill I use it? We'll have to wait and see. ðŸ˜…\n",
