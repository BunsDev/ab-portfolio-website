From January this year, I started journaling with a pen on a paper. I used to do it digitally on apps earlier but I could never stick with it for long.

With a few missing days, I've been consistently writing a journal till now. I mainly write morning pages, a concept or a tool, that I've taken from [The Artist's Way](https://aravindballa.com/bookshelf/the-artists-way-28946040/).

Why pen and paper?
