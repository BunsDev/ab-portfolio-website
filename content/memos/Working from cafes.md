description: 'Working from anywhere is a skill that can be built'

A friend recently asked me how I get work done when I roam around, hopping in cafes. I jotting down my experiences here.

Ability get stuff done while roaming around is a skill which can be built. I've been practising this for almost 4 years.

I feel the main thing we miss when we are not at a designated place to work, be it a room at your home or your office, is a structure. Getting into the zone gets difficult.

*ðŸš§ This post is still a work in progress. It's late in the night and I don't want to compromise on sleep for this article. I will finish this soon.*

- Make an agenda before you go to the cafe
- Follow Pomodoro schedule to work in time blocks
- If you are with a bunch of friends, make sure you all are on the same page and all of you are going there to get some work done
- Focusing in scheduled time requires practice. It will be tough in the beginning
- Work only in the scheduled pomodoro blocks. Giving yourself less time for a task makes sure you are focused and not distracted.
- Enjoy good food.
- Enjoy your time with friends - this keeps you recharged for a few days.
